<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Chapter I—Annie’s Story.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE DAUGHTERS.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>There are three of us, Fanny and Annie (that is myself)
and Katy, who is our half-sister and several years
our junior. Her mother, a blue-eyed, golden-haired little
woman from New Orleans, lived only a year after she
came to us, and just before she died she took my sister’s
hand and mine, and putting one of her baby’s between
them, said, “Be kind to her as I would have been kind
to you had I lived. God bless you all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We were only nine years old, but we accepted the trust
as something sacred, and little Katy, who inherited all of
her mother’s marvelous beauty and sweetness of disposition,
never missed a mother’s love and care, and was the
pet and darling of our household. Fanny and I are
twins,—familiarly known as “Fan-and-Ann,”—and as unlike
each other as it is possible for twins to be. Fan, who
always passes for the elder, is half a head taller than
I am, and very beautiful, with a stateliness and imperiousness
of manner which would befit a queen, while I am shy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and reticent and small, and only one has ever called me
handsome. But his opinion is more to me than all the
world, and so I am content, although as a young girl, I
used sometimes to envy Fan her beauty, and think I would
rather be known as “the pretty and proud Miss Hathern”
than “the plain and good one,” a distinction often made
between us, and one which I knew made me the more
popular of the two.</p>

<p class='c014'>Our home, which was sometimes called “The Elms,”
on account of the great number of elm trees around it,
was in the part of Virginia that felt the shock of the war
the most, and when the thunder of artillery was shaking
the hills around Petersburg and the air was black with
shot and shell and the gutters ran red with human blood,
Fanny and I, with little Katy between us, sat with blanched
faces listening to the distant roar,—she thinking of the
cause she had so much at heart and feared was lost,
and I of the thousands of homes made desolate by the
dreadful war which, it seemed to me, need never to have
been. As we were southern born we naturally sympathized
with the south,—that is, Fanny did,—while our
father, who was born under the shadow of Bunker Hill,
and rarely had any very decided opinions except for peace
and good will everywhere, scarcely knew on which side
he did stand. Both were right and both were wrong, he
said, and he opposed secession with all his might, insisting
that there must be some better method of settling the
difficulty than by plunging the nation into a sea of carnage.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was for “peace at any price,” and held the flag as
a sacred thing, and at last when war was upon us, he
reverently laid away in the garret the one with which we
were wont to celebrate the Fourth of July, and night and
morning prayed for both sides,—not that either might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>victorious, but that they might settle the difficulty amicably
and go home.</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother, whom I can scarcely remember, was a
Charlestonian, who believed in slavery as a divine institution,
and was the kindest and gentlest of mistresses to the
few negroes she brought with her to her Virginia home.
For myself I scarcely knew what I did believe, except as
I was swayed by a stronger spirit than my own, and that
spirit was Fan’s. She was an out and out rebel, as we were
called, and lamented that instead of a girl of thirteen she
was not a man to join the first company of volunteers
which went from Lovering. Situated as we were, near the
frontier, we were fair prey for the soldiers on both sides,
and they came upon us like the locusts of Egypt and spoiled
us almost as badly as the Egyptians were spoiled by the
Israelites, but from neither north nor south did we ever
suffer a personal indignity. This was largely owing to
our father’s incomparable tact in dealing with them. It
seemed to me that he was always watching for them, and
when he came in from the street, or the gate where he
spent a great deal of his time, I could tell to a certainty
whether we were to expect a Federal or a Confederate
before he spoke a word. If it were the latter he came to
me and said, “Annie, there are soldiers in town and if
they come here, as they may, stay in your room until they
are gone.” If it were the boys in blue, he went to Fan,
but did not tell her to stay in her room. He knew she
would not if he did, and he would say in his most conciliatory
way, “Daughter, I think there are some Federals
in the woods, and if they come here as they may because
the house is large and handy, try and be civil to them,
and don’t be afraid.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Afraid!” Fan would answer, with a flash in her black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>eyes. “Do you think I would be afraid if the entire northern
army stood at our door!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she would hurry off to warn the blacks in the
kitchen and see that the coffee and sugar and tea were
hidden away, while father walked down to the gate to receive
the foremost of his unwelcome guests. With a courtly
wave of the hand, which he might have borrowed from
kings, he would say, “What can I do for you to-day?
I suppose you are hungry, but we have been visited so
often that we have not much left. Still I think we can
give you something; but, gentlemen, I beg of you not to
annoy or frighten my daughters. They are very young
and their mother is dead.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Whether it was what he said, or the way he said it, or
both, his wishes so far as we were concerned were respected,
and neither Fanny nor I ever came near a boy in blue
or a boy in grey that he did not touch his cap to us, and
when Fan’s sharp tongue got the better of her, as it often
did, they only laughed, and told her to “dry up,” a bit
of slang she did not then understand and resented hotly as
a Yankee insult. They took our poultry and eggs and
fruit and flour and finally all our negroes, except Phyllis,
who had her bundle made up to go, and then found that her
love for “Ole Mas’r” and the young “misseses” was
stronger than her love for freedom.</p>

<p class='c014'>On one occasion they took Black Beauty, Fan’s riding
pony, but sent it back within a few hours. This was
toward the close of the war, when Virginia was full of
Federal troops, and for one day and night our place was
turned into a kind of barracks by a company whose leader,
Col. Errington, occupied our best room and took his meals
with us. He was a tall, handsome man, with a splendid
physique and the most polished manners I ever saw. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>there was a cynical look about his mouth and a cold, hard
expression in his grey eyes, which I did not like, while
Fan detested him. She was then a beautiful girl of nearly
seventeen, with a haughty bearing and frankness of speech
which amused the northern officer, to whom she expressed
her mind very freely, not only with regard to his calling,
but also with regard to himself. But he took it all
good-humoredly, and when he went away he kissed his
hand to her, while to me he simply bowed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The wretch! How dare he!” Fanny said, with a stamp
of her foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>But she watched him until he disappeared from sight
in the woods, through which there was a short cut in the
direction of Petersburg. Most of his men followed him,
but a few stragglers lingered behind for the sake of whatever
they could find in the shape of eatables, and when
at last they departed, Phyllis, who had been doing battle
with them over a quantity of butternuts which she claimed
as her special property, came running to the house
with the startling information that “one dem blue coats
done took off Miss Fanny’s pony, who kicked and snorted
jes ’s if he knowed ’twas a fetched Yank who had cotched
him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Rushing to the door we saw the pony going down the
lane, or rather standing in the lane, for he had planted his
forefeet firmly on the ground, and with mulish obstinacy
refused to move. A sharp cut from the whip, however,
brought him to terms, and he went galloping off with his
heels in the air quite as often as upon terra firma. I
think Fan followed him bareheaded for nearly a mile, but
all her calls and entreaties were in vain. Black Beauty
was gone, and she cried herself into a headache which
lasted until night, when, just as we were sitting down to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>supper, Phyllis came near dropping the hot corn cakes she
was putting upon the table in her surprise and delight as
she exclaimed, “Bress de Lord, dar’s Black Beauty now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Looking from the window we saw a soldier in blue leading
him toward the house and trying hard to hold him as
he minced and pranced and shook his head in his delight
to be home again. In a moment he was at the open door
where he often came to be fed with sugar or cookies and
Fan’s arms were around his neck and she was talking to
him as if he was human and could understand her, while
he whinnied in reply and rubbed his head against her
face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Col. Errington sent you this with his compliments,”
the soldier said, handing a note to Fan, which was as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Hathern</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I have just learned of the abduction of your pony,
and am very sorry for the anxiety it must have caused
you. I am sure it is yours, as you ran so far after him,
and for that reason I should like to keep him for myself.
But honor compels me to send him back.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hoping that you will not add the sin of thieving to my
other enormities and that in the near future we may meet
as friends instead of foes,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am, yours very truly,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>“<span class='sc'>George W. Errington</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Fan’s first impulse, after reading this, was to tear it up,
but she changed her mind, and I heard her tell Phyllis to
give the soldier some supper, if he wanted it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose the tramp is hungry; they always are,”
she said, apologetically, as her eyes wandered across the
orchard to the enclosure on the hillside where, under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>pine trees, our boy in grey was lying, with a boy in blue
beside him.</p>

<p class='c014'>That night I saw Fan put Col. Errington’s note in a
little box on our dressing bureau, where she kept her few
trinkets, but his name was not mentioned between us until
after the fall of Richmond, when Jack Fullerton, our
neighbor, who had been in the war and who knew about
Fan’s pony and the officer, whom he teasingly called
Fan’s Yankee, brought a Washington paper in which we
read that Col. Errington, who was so severely wounded
at Petersburg, was recovering rapidly and would soon be
able to be moved into his house on Franklin Square.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose you are very glad that your gallant Colonel
is getting well,” Jack said, and Fan replied, “Of
course I am. Do you think me a murderess that I want
any man to die.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I thought at one time you would like to exterminate
the entire Federal army,” Jack said, and Fan replied,
“So I would, and I have no love for them now; but can’t
a body change some of his views?”</p>

<p class='c014'>And, truly, Fan’s views were greatly changed from
what they were at the beginning of the war, to which time
I must go back for a little and tell of the boy in grey and
the boy in blue, who brought the change and who, though
dead, have much to do with this story.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter II—An Episode.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE BOY IN GREY AND THE BOY IN BLUE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have written of Dr. Hathern’s daughters, but have
said nothing of his son, our brother Charlie, who was
four years our senior and little more than a boy when the
war broke out. Too young by far to join the army, father
and I said. But Fan thought differently, and when the
clouds of strife grew darker and denser and there were
calls for more recruits she urged him on until at last he
enlisted and we saw him with others march away on the
Monday after the Easter of ’62. How handsome he was
in his new uniform, and how proud we were of him, he was
so tall and straight, with such a sunny smile on his boyish
face and in his laughing blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bress de boy; he look like Sol’mon in all his best
clos’,” Phyllis said, regarding him admiringly when he
put them on, “an’ though I spec’s I’se a mighty bad
un seein’ I’se a nigger and one of Linkum’s folks, I hope
he’ll beat ’em sho’.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Beat them! Of course we shall!” Fan said, putting
her arms around Charlie’s neck and laying a hand on the
shoulder of Jack Fullerton, who had also enlisted. “Of
course we shall beat them. The Northerners are all cowards.
One or two battles will end the matter and you will
come marching home covered with glory.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was talking mostly to Jack, flashing upon him a
look from her bright eyes which would have made a
less brave man face the cannon’s mouth. Jack had been
my hero since my earliest remembrance, although I knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>that he preferred Fan, who was tall and fair and comely,
while I was short and dark and homely. It was mainly
owing to her influence that he had enlisted, and he was to
dine with us that Easter Day as his father was dead and
his mother, who was an invalid, was away at some springs.
How bright we made the house with the lilies Charlie was
so fond of, saying they made him think of his mother and
the angels, and I never see one now, nor inhale its perfume,
that it does not bring Charlie back to me as he was that
last day at home when there were great bowls of them on
the mantels and stands and dinner table, which was loaded
with every delicacy Phyllis could devise. The rooms
looked as if decked for a bridal, but they seemed like a
funeral, we were all so sad, except Fan. She was in the
wildest of spirits and talked of the next Easter when the
war would be over, and Charlie with us again, wearing
shoulder straps may be, or at all events covered with honor
as a soldier who had done his duty.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are not going to be shot, but to shoot somebody,”
she said, patting him on his back. “And we’ll
trim the house up better than it is to-day, and Phyllis shall
make her best plum pudding, and I shall be so proud of
you,” she added, throwing her arms around his neck,
and kissing him lovingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next morning he went away and we saw him marching
by to the sound of the fife and drum, while I cried
as if my heart would break, but Fanny stood upon the
horse block by the gate and sent kisses after him until a
turn in the road hid him from our sight. We heard from
him often during the summer, for many men from our
county were in the same regiment, and so, from one and
another and from himself word came to us that he was
well and had as yet seen no actual fighting, though very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>anxious to do so. Then the tone of his letters changed
a little and he was not quite so ready to fight.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I tell you what, Fan-and-Ann,” he wrote, “the boys
in blue are not such milksops as you think. I have seen
quite a lot of ’em, and they are a pretty good sort after
all, and they gave me tobacco and hard tack and a newspaper,
and said they’d nothing against me personally, but
they had enlisted to lick just such upstarts and were going
to do it. I’d smile to see them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And so would I,” Fan said, with the utmost scorn,
“lick us indeed! I wish I were a man!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was growing more bitter every day, and when one
evening Phyllis came to me privately and said there was a
half-starved Federal soldier hiding in the corn-field, I did
not dare tell Fan, but went to him with Phyllis after dark
and carried him bread and milk and a blanket to cover
him and an umbrella to shield him from the rain. The
third day he went away and I never heard from him again
until the war was over, when I received a badly written
letter, directed wrong side up and signed James Josh,
who thanked me for my kindness which he had never forgotten.
I passed the letter to Fan, who surprised me by
saying, “Yes, I knew all about it; I saw you steal off into
the corn-field and saw you feeding that poor wretch, and
only a thought of Charlie and what I’d wish someone to do
for him kept me from giving notice that a Yankee was
hiding in our field. I knew when he went away and saw
you and Phyllis coddle him up with sandwiches and hoe-cake and father’s old coat, and you took me to task for
flirting in front of the house with Jack Fullerton, who
was home on a furlough, when I was really trying to keep
him as long as possible so as to let your James Josh get
out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Fanny was greatly softened at that time and not much
like the fierce, outspoken girl who kept us up to fever heat
during the second year of the war when the weeks and
months dragged so slowly until at last it was winter and
news came of the terrible battle of Fredericksburg, when
the woods were filled with the dead and dying and the
river ran red with blood. Three days after the battle they
brought Charlie to us dead, with a bullet in his side and a
look of perfect peace on his young face, smooth yet and fair
as a girl’s. Some of his friends had found him in the woods,
and rather than leave him there had at the risk of their
own lives managed to have him carried across the country
until at the close of the third day he lay in our best room
where so many lilies had been when he went away, but
which now echoed to father’s sobs and mine as we bent
over our dead boy. Fan never shed a tear, but in a cold,
hard voice told the men where to put the body, and then
with a start, exclaimed, “What does this mean?” and she
pointed to his uniform, which was not the grey he had
worn away, but the blue she so hated, and which was
much too small for him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Some thief exchanged with him, for see, there is no
hole where the bullet struck him,” she continued, looking
at the coat which was stained with blood, but whole.
“Phyllis, come here,” she went on, while father and I sat
dumb and helpless, “take off that garb of a dog and put
his own clothes on him, his best ones, hanging in his
room.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Phyllis obeyed, and when the soiled and bloody garments
lay upon the floor, Fan said, “give me the tongs,
I am going to burn them up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then father arose and reaching out his shaking hands
saved the blue uniform from the flames.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Wait, Fan,” he said; “there may be something in
the pockets which will tell us whose clothes they are.
Remember there are more aching hearts than ours.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was feeling in the trousers pockets where securely
pinned in the bottom of one was the half sheet of paper
which we had fastened in the top of Charlie’s cap because
it was too large. The paper was written over in a scrawly
hand which was not Charlie’s, and Fan read it aloud with
the tears streaming down her cheeks, just as mine are falling
now, as I copy it verbatim:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Father and Fan-and-Ann</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I am dying under a tree in the woods with a bullet in
me and a boy’s cap stuffed into the wound to keep the
blood back, while I tell him what to write. Lucky Fan-and-Ann
thought to put that paper in my cap. The boy,
who is a Yankee, found me and brought me some water
and covered me with his coat when I got cold and stuffed
his cap into the hole and cried over me, and I cried too,
and we’ve talked it over and are as sorry as we can be—about
the war, I mean. I hope I didn’t kill anybody
and he hopes he didn’t, and his left hand is almost shot
away and hurts him awful, but he’s going to stick to me
till I’m dead. Then I’ve told him how to find his way to
you and tell you about me, and you must take care of him
and not let them get him. He don’t want to go to prison,
and I don’t want to have him, and he’s going to change
clothes with me so as to look like a confederate. We’ve
said the Lord’s Prayer together, and Now I lay me, and
the Creed, and dearly beloved, and everything we could
think of and he knows them just as I do and I reckon I’m
all right with God, only I’d like to die at home. It’s
getting dark and the boy is tired and I am faint. Kiss
little Katy for me. I wish I could see you all again.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Good-bye, be kind to the boy. Give my respects to
Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>This was the letter and I need not say that the blue
uniform was not burned; neither did I know what became
of it until after the funeral was over and I had courage to
go into my brother’s room where I found it hanging on
the wall and over it the Stars and Stripes which Fan had
brought from their hiding place and put above the faded
blue, from which the blood stains could not be effaced,
although Phyllis had washed it two or three times. Every
day Fan and I went in and looked at it and cried over it
and talked of <em>The Boy</em> and wondered who he was and
when, if ever, he would come.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What shall you do if he does?” I asked her once, but
she only glared at me like a tiger and I was glad to escape
from the scornful gleam of her eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>And thus the weeks glided into months and it was spring
again and the Virginia woods were lovely in their dress of
green; the robins were building their nests in the trees
and the lilies we were to lay on Charlie’s grave at Easter
were just breaking into bloom. Father had gone to visit
a patient, Katy was at school, and Fan and I sat by the
dining-room fire when Phyllis came in, and, cautiously
shutting the door, said in a mysterious whisper, “He’s
done come.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who has come?” I asked, and Phyllis replied, “The
Boy, to be sho’; him you’re spectin’, honey, Mas’r
Charles’s boy, and oh, de Lord, such a bag of bones, and
so scar’t for fear he’ll be took.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where is he?” Fan asked, springing to her feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In my cabin, in course. Whar should he be?” was
Phyllis’s answer, and in a moment Fan and I were on our
way to the cabin, the door of which we could not open.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go to the windy behine de cabin, honey,” Phyllis
said, puffing after us like an engine.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>We went to the rear window, which was open, and through
which Fan darted like a cat, while I followed almost as
quickly. Against the door a most heterogenous mass of
furniture was piled. A table, two wooden chairs, a wash tub,
iron kettle, stewpan, skillet and billet of wood, while
a large nail was driven over the latch.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What upon earth is this for. I should think you were
shutting out an army,” Fan said, and Phyllis, who
had managed to squeeze through the window, replied,
“An’ so I is, de Federate’s army, too. I’se not gwine
to have him took, an’ he beggin’ of me not to; I’ll spill
my heart’s blood first.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She had seized a big rolling pin which she flourished
energetically, looking as if she might keep a whole regiment
at bay.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Move those things and open that door,” Fan said
authoritatively, and then we turned our attention to the
boy, lying on Phyllis’s bed, a mere skeleton, with masses
of light curly hair and great sunken blue eyes which looked
up at us so pitifully as we bent over him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You won’t let ’em get me?” he whispered, with a
faint smile, “I am so sick and my head aches so, and my
hand is so bad. He said you were good, but I didn’t
know there were two of you; which is Fan-an-Ann?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan and I looked curiously at each other a moment;
then, remembering that Charlie always spoke of us as Fan-an-Ann,
and that it was so written in the letter, we understood
his mistake. But it was Fan who answered, for
I could only stand and cry over this wreck of a boy, with
Charlie’s battered clothes upon him, too long and large
every way, and covered with soil and blood stains. What
remained of his left hand was bound in a dirty rag and
quivered with pain as it lay on the coarse blanket.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“What shall we do?” I asked at last, and Fan answered
in her imperious way, which always made one feel small.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do! Go to the house and get Charlie’s bed ready,
and bring me his dressing gown and a shirt and drawers
from his trunk. This is no time to cry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I knew then that Lee’s entire army could not wrest that
boy from Fan, who helped Phyllis remove his stiff garments
and wash the aching limbs, scarcely larger than sticks,
and who herself undid the bandage from the wounded
hand which she bathed so carefully and bound up so skillfully
in the lint and linen which I brought her; then, when
all was done, she wrapped a blanket around him and took
him in her own strong arms, not daring to trust him to
Phyllis, who weighed a hundred and eighty and was apt
to stumble. It was curious to see Fan, who had been so
bitter against the north, carrying that Yankee boy up to
the house and laying him on Charlie’s bed, at the foot of
which, on the wall, his own uniform was hanging. He saw
it at once, for his eyes seemed to see everything, and with
a smile on his white face, he said, “Why, there’s my old
clothes. They were too small for him but I managed to
get them on him as he told me, and I pinned the letter in
his pockets, thinking if he got to you and I didn’t, you’d
know; did you find it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” Fan answered, “and now tell me why you were
so long in coming?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was very weak and could only talk at intervals in
whispers, as he replied, “I lost the way and was sick in
a negro’s cabin ever so long. They took as good care of me
as they could and hid me away when danger was near,—sometimes
under the bed, and once in the pounding barrel,
and once in the meal chest, where I was nearly
smothered.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“Hid you from what?” Fan asked, and he replied, with
a gleam in his blue eyes, “From the rebels, of course,
don’t you know I’m a Yank?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes; go on and tell us of Charlie,” Fan said, a little
sharply, and he went on very slowly and stopping sometimes
with closed eyes, as if he were asleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was in the battle,—Fredericksburg, you know. It
was awful. ’Twas the first I had really been in, and I
was so scar’t, and wanted to run away, but couldn’t; when
I got over it I guess I was crazy with the roar and shouts
and yells from horses and dying men. Did you ever hear
a thousand men scream in mortal pain?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan shook her head and he continued: “It’s awful, but
the horses are the worst; I hear them now. I shall always
hear them till I die.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He stopped and there came a look upon his face which
we feared was death. But Fan bathed his forehead with
eau-de-cologne and moistened his lips with water until he
revived, and said, “Where did I leave off. Oh, yes, I
know; till I die. I got over being scar’t and fought like
a bloodhound and wanted to kill them all. I am sorry
now and hope I didn’t kill any one. Do you think I did?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan did not answer, and he continued: “When it was
over, I got separated from our army somehow and wandered
in the woods and cried, my hand ached so, and I was
so cold and hungry. Then I heard somebody crying
harder than I, or groaning like, and I hunted till I found
him under a tree, all bloody and white. I knew he was a
boy in grey, but I didn’t care, nor he either; we was boys
together, and I knelt down by him and told him I was
sorry and asked what I could do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Write to Fan-an-Ann,’ he said, and I wrote it on a
stone, and my hand hurt me so; we said some prayers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>together, Our Father, and Now I lay me, and some more
that we made up about forgiving us and going to Heaven;
and he’s all right and was awfully sorry about the war,
and so am I, and when he got took in his head he talked
of Easter and the lilies which you have then, and said he
could smell them, and he said a good deal about Fan-an-Ann.
And then I took his head in my lap and kissed him
and he kissed me for his father and for Fan-an-Ann, and
he said I was to tell her he was not afraid, for he was going
to his mother, and then he died—Oh, yes, he said something
about little Katy and kissing her. Don’t cry, it makes
me feel so bad,” and opening his great blue eyes he
looked at Fan, down whose face the tears were running
like rain, and who, stooping down, pressed her lips to
those of the boy who had kissed our dying brother.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go on,” she said softly, and he went on: “I changed
clothes as he told me and prayed that his folks might find
him and bring him to you and that I might get here, too,
and not be taken prisoner, and I have, but the way was
so long and hard and I am so tired and sick and sorry.
You won’t let them get me, sure?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never!” and Fan made me think of some wild animal
guarding its young, as she drew the sheet over the boy,
whose mind began to wander and from whom we could
extract but little more and that little was very unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Fan who talked most with him and who asked
him his name.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My real one, or the one I had with the boys?” he said,
and she replied, “your real one, so I can write to your
mother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a look of cunning in his bright eyes, as he
replied, “I hain’t no mother, except Aunt Martha, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>she won’t care, and I don’t want her to know. I ran
away from her and enlisted after a while. I was <em>Joe</em> with
the boys, but that ain’t the name they gave me in baptism.
Do you know the Apostles?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I am one of them. Now guess,” he said, and
beginning with Matthew and ending with Paul Fan went
over the entire list, but the expression of the boy’s face
never changed in the least; nor did he give any sign when
she spoke his name, if she did speak it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Joe will do,” he said. “Aunt Martha has washed
her hands of me a good many times. She was always
washing them. She don’t mind whether I am Joe or an
Apostle.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But where is your home? Where does Aunt Martha
live?” Fan asked, and he replied, “She don’t live there
now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Evidently he did not care to talk of his home, which
could not have been a very happy one, judging from what
he did say. He called me <em>Ann-an-Fan</em>, while Fan was
<em>Fan-an-Ann</em>, and his eyes brightened when she came
near him, and he smiled upon her in a way which always
brought the tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are just as good as northern folks,” he said to
her once, “and I am sorry I came down to lick you; I wish
I had something to give you. Where are my trousers?”
Phyllis had washed and ironed the ragged greys and put
back in the pocket everything she found there—a jews-harp,
a ball of twine, some nails, and a pearl handled knife
with three blades, two of which were broken; this with
the jews-harp he gave to Fan to remember him by, he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Carlyle gave me the knife one Christmas, and I gave
him a lead pencil. I couldn’t get anything more, for I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>hadn’t any money. I’d been bad; I was always bad, and
Aunt Martha wouldn’t give me any,” he said, and when
Fan asked him who Carlyle was, he answered, “Oh, a boy
I used to know and like. If you see him tell him so, and
that I have never told that he took the cake, and wouldn’t
if I lived to be a hundred. Aunt Martha whaled me for it,
and my, didn’t she put it on; I was too big to be thrashed,
and I ran away not long after that, and went to a grocery
and then to the war, and she thinks now that I stole the
cake!”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was all we could possibly get from him, and we did
not know how much reliance to put upon it, he was delirious
so much of the time.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first father thought to amputate his hand but finally
gave that up. It was useless to torture him, he said, as
he could not last long, and he did not. It was Monday
evening when he came to us and he lingered for three
days, sometimes sleeping quietly and sometimes raving
about the war and Charlie and the long weary road he had
traveled to reach us and Fan-an-Ann and Ann-an-Fan,
clinging most to Fan, who watched him day and night as
tenderly as if it had been Charlie instead of one of the
race she had affected to hate. Once he seemed to be at
his old home, and in fear of punishment, for he begged
piteously of Aunt Martha to spare him from something, we
could not tell what, and he asked us twice not to let her
find him, saying he would not go back to her. Again he
spoke of a little out of the way town in Maine which Fan
wrote down for future reference. Everything about him
was wrapped in mystery except the fact that he was
there with us, the boy who had cared for our dying brother
and for whom we cared to the last. When the morning
of Good Friday dawned he sank into a stupor from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>which we thought he would never awaken, but when the
church bell rang for service he started up and opening his
eyes said to Fan, “What’s that? Is it Sunday and must
I go to Sunday School? I hain’t my lesson.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is Good Friday,” Fan replied, and he continued:
“Oh, yes; Good Friday, and Easter; I know. We had
’em down in Maine, and the lilies, too, that he told me
about in the woods, and I once spoke a piece. Do you
want to hear it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan nodded, and raising himself in bed, he began:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Softly now the Easter sunlight</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Falls on Judea’s wooded hills,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shining redly through the tree tops,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Lighting up the running rills.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>While all things in earth and heaven</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sing aloud with one acclaim</div>
      <div class='line'>Glory in the highest, Glory,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Glory be to Jesus’ name.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“There was a lot more, but I can’t remember how it
goes. Carlyle spoke a piece, too, and did first rate for a
little shaver. I taught it to him, but ’twas hard work,
as he’d rather play with Don,—that’s the dog. Tell him
good-bye, and good-bye Fan-an-Ann, and Ann-an-Fan.
Queer that there’s two of you. I don’t believe he knew,
but I’ll tell him, and that they were good to me and didn’t
let ’em catch me. Now say ‘Our Father,’ for I am getting
sleepy, and it is growing dark.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Fan who said it; I could not speak, for I saw
the death pallor gather on the face of the boy, who repeated
with Fan the familiar words.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That makes it about square with me and Jesus, and
I guess that he won’t turn off a poor boy like me,” he said,
and then for a time he was back again at Fredericksburg,
fighting like a little bear; then with Charlie in the woods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>singing a low lullaby such as mothers sing to their restless
infants; then in the meal chest and under the bed
and in the pounding barrel, shivering with fear, and at last
with Fan-an-Ann, who he said was a <em>brick</em>. Then he seemed
to listen intently, and whispered, “Hark. Don’t you
hear the guns? how they bang away; and how red the
river runs; and how fast the men go down! Oh, God,
have pity on us all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment he lay quiet; then, rousing again, called
out triumphantly, “The war is over; the victory is won;
Hurrah for——.” He meant to say “The boys in
blue.” He had said it often in his delirium, but something
in Fan’s eyes checked him, and after looking steadily
at her an instant he raised his right arm in the air and
called out in a clear, shrill voice, “Hurrah for Fan-an-Ann;
three cheers and a tiger, too!” then the hand
dropped upon his breast and The Boy was dead.</p>

<p class='c014'>The neighbors for miles around had heard of him and
many had come to us bringing delicacies and flowers and
offering assistance, if it were needed. The aid Fan declined,
but took the flowers and fruit to the boy, telling
him who sent them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are very kind,” he said. “I guess I’m
some reconstructed, though I am a Yank yet and stick
to the flag. <em>Yes, sir!</em>”</p>

<p class='c014'>Neither Fan nor I could repress a smile at the energy
with which he asserted his loyalty to his cause, and neither
liked him the less for it. Fan, too, must have been
“some reconstructed,” for she cared for him to the last
as tenderly as if he had been her brother, and when he
was dead, she with Phyllis made him ready for the grave,
crying over him as she had not cried when Charlie died.
Then her tears would not come, but now they fell in torrents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>as she brushed his wavy hair, which had grown
rather long and lay in soft rings about his forehead,
giving him the look of a young girl, rather than a boy,
whose age we could not guess. We cut off two or three
of his curls and put them, with the letter he had written
for Charlie, into the pocket of the blue uniform which,
with the grey, we left hanging on the wall in Charlie’s
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>We buried him on Easter day, and he had the largest
funeral ever seen in the neighborhood, for everybody came,
and his coffin, over which we hung the Federal flag, was
heaped with lilies, which were afterwards dropped into his
grave. Then we tried to find his friends, but with only
Aunt Martha and Carlyle and the little town in Maine to
guide us, it proved a fruitless task.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan wrote to the postmaster of the town in Maine,
giving all the particulars, and after two months or more
she received an answer from the postmaster’s wife, who
said that during the first year of the war a company had
gone from an adjoining town and in it was a boy, who gave
his name as Joseph Wilde. He was a comparative stranger
in town and had been for a short time in the employ of a
grocer, who spoke very highly of him. But where he came
from no one knew, or if he had any friends. And that was
all we could learn of “The Boy,” whom we buried on
the hillside beside our brother. At the head of his grave
is a plain marble slab, and on it “The Boy, who died
Good Friday, 1863.” This was Fan’s idea, and every
Decoration Day after the war was over she used to hang
the Stars and Bars over Charlie’s grave and the Stars
and Stripes over the grave of The Boy, who has slept
there now for many a year and will sleep there until from
the North and the South, the East and the West, the boys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>in blue and the boys in grey will come together, a vast
army, and what was crooked to them here will be made
plain and we, who now see through a glass darkly, will
then see face to face in the light of the Resurrection
morning.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span><br> <span class='c013'>AFTER THE WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>We had done our best to win and had failed. We were
conquered, but in Lovering at least we accepted the situation
and rejoiced for the peace and quiet which came to us
with the disappearance of the soldiers from our soil. Even
Fan was glad to go to bed feeling sure that her sleep would
not be disturbed by the tramp of horses’ feet or the clamor
of hungry men for food and shelter. Our little town had
been visited so often by both armies and levied on so frequently
for means to carry on the war that its people were
greatly impoverished. Whether it were that our house was
larger and our accommodations generally more ample, or
that our father’s manner of receiving an unwelcome visitor
was different from our neighbors, we seemed to have
suffered most. Our horses and cows and sheep were gone.
Our negroes were gone with the exception of Phyllis, who,
after her first attempt to leave, stood firmly by us, refusing
wages after she knew she was free.</p>

<p class='c014'>Only poor white truck work for pay, and she wasn’t one
of them, she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>Our timber was damaged for the soldiers had cut down
the trees in our woods for their camp fires, and worst of
all our father’s patients were mostly gone. Belonging to
the old school, in which he believed as he did in his religion,
he adhered strictly to his morphine and calomel, and
when a young physician from Richmond opened an office
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in town, with little bottles and little pills, and prices to correspond,
the people flocked to him, and father was left
with only a few patients and a long list of uncollectible bills
against some of the deserters. Both Fan and I inclined to
homeopathy and urged him to adopt it to some extent, but
he shook his head. He had sat on the fence during the
war, he said, and received only kicks from either side,
and now he should stick to his principles and allopathy if
he starved. We did not starve, but we were at times in
great straits. Fan and I made over our old dresses for
ourselves and little Katy, and we brushed and mended
father’s clothes, which, in spite of our care grew more
and more threadbare and shabby until his dress coat was
the only garment which was not shiny and had not more
or less darns in it. This he always wore to dinner, partly
from habit, partly to please us, and more I think to
please old Phyllis, who felt that the glory of the family
had not quite departed so long as the swallow tail appeared
at dinner, even if it were laid aside the moment the
meal was over. There was no denying the fact that grim
poverty was staring us in the face, and no one felt it
more keenly than Phyllis, who, although she would take
nothing from us, offered to hire out for wages which she
would give to us. This we would not allow, and we struggled
on through the summer, raising and selling what
we could from our land, which we all worked together,
and living on as little as it was possible for five people to
live upon. Fan suffered the most, she was so proud and
so luxurious in her tastes and so averse to any thing like
economy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’d do anything for money,” she said one day to Jack
Fullerton, who was helping us pick our grapes, which he
was to sell for us in Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Jack had won his shoulder-straps and was a lieutenant
when the war closed, but he dropped the title with his
uniform and was only Jack to us,—a handsome, honest-hearted
young man, whom everybody liked, whom I
adored in secret, and whom Fan worried and teased and
flirted with outrageously. She knew he loved her, and I
believed she loved him in return. But she encouraged him
one day and repelled him the next, saying often in his
presence that she should never marry unless the man had
money and it would be useless for one without it to offer
himself to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I’d better not do it,” Jack would say, jokingly,
with the most intense love burning in his eyes and sounding
in his voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, you’d better not, if you don’t want me to refuse
to speak to you again,” she would answer, with a laugh
and a look which only made him more in love than ever.</p>

<p class='c014'>He knew she cared for him, and that it was only the
barrier of poverty which stood between them. And so
they joked and quarreled and made up, and he was with
us every day, helping in the garden and yard and at last
with the grapes, of which we had quantities that year.
Father was in Boston, where he had gone on some business
which he hoped might result in a little profit. While
there he had, through the influence of a friend, been called
to see a Mrs. Haverleigh, who was very ill. As her family
physician was in Europe she had asked him to attend
her until she was better. To this he had consented and had
been gone from home three or four weeks. Knowing that
our grapes must be picked Jack had offered his services
and on a lovely September morning we were all out by
the vines filling the baskets with great purple clusters of
fruit which Jack sometimes cut for us and sometimes Fan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>who was in wild spirits. She had taken her turn at cutting
and was sitting half way up the step-ladder, looking
very lovely and picturesque against the green background,
in her old black skirt and scarlet jacket, with the bright
color in her face and her hair blowing around her forehead.
A handsome carriage drawn by a span of fine horses
had gone by. Its occupants,—a gentleman and lady,—seemed
to be scanning our house curiously. We could see
the lady distinctly and felt sure she was from some city,
Richmond presumably, and Fan was speculating about
her and wishing she could ride in her carriage, when I
heard a step on the grass, and a tall distinguished-looking
man came towards us. In his citizen’s dress I did
not at once recognize him; but Fan did, and, without
coming from her perch, exclaimed, “Col. Errington!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I knew the handsome officer, who had once been
our guest and who now greeted us with the smile I remembered
so well, because it had in it something so cold
and patronizing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good afternoon, Colonel,” Fan said to him. “You
have come back to see your conquered enemies, I suppose.
We heard of your promotion and of the bullet wound some
of our boys gave you at Petersburg. Was it in your
back?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was very saucy, and for an instant a hot color flamed
into the Colonel’s face, and there came into his grey
eyes a red look such as I had seen once or twice when
he was quartered upon us and his men displeased him. But
it quickly faded under the spell of Fan’s beauty, and the
light which flashed from her eyes and belied her words.</p>

<p class='c014'>Laughing good-humoredly, the colonel replied, “Rebellious
as ever, I see; I hoped I might find you reconstructed.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Not a bit of it,” Fan said, stepping down from the
ladder and running her fingers through her hair, by which
means she left a long mark of grape juice on her forehead.
“We are just as big rebels as ever. You beat us
because you had more men and money, and we were
obliged to give up. It was like a big dog fighting a little
dog, which has just as much courage and more, too, than
the big one, but is finally worn out by strength rather
than by skill. Do you see the point?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I see,” he said, “and in Constantinople I have
also seen the big dog, after the fight was over, take the
little one in its paws and toss it up and fondle it as if there
had been no bone of contention. I hope it may be so
in this case.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no mistaking the admiration with which the
Colonel regarded Fan. Jack saw it and drew a step
nearer to her, while she answered hotly, “Never! We are
not Turks, and only a dog would suffer itself to be fondled
by the hand which had whipped it.” Then she added
with a laugh: “Don’t let us quarrel over spilled milk,
but let me present to you my friend, Lieut. Fullerton, Col.
Errington.”</p>

<p class='c014'>During the skirmish between the Colonel and Fan, I
had mentally contrasted the two men, Jack and the
Colonel, between whose ages there was a difference of
several years. Both were tall and erect, with a bearing
which comes only from military discipline. By the majority
of people the Colonel would have been called the
finer looking, as he was the more <i><span lang="fr">distingué</span></i>, with his polish
and air of fashion and city breeding. But to me he bore
no comparison to Jack Fullerton, with his honest face
and kindly smile and eyes which met yours fearlessly.
His clothes were shabby and country made, it is true; his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>shoes were worn and grey, and his hands were not as soft
and white as those which the Colonel had a trick of rubbing
together as he talked, and on one of which a small
diamond was shining. But they were helpful hands,
ready always for service both to friend or foe, and in his
heart no passions had ever stirred like those which at
times showed themselves on Col. Errington’s face.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the introduction the two men, who had fought
against each other in more than one battle, shook hands
as cordially as if they had been old friends and for a few
moments chatted together pleasantly. Then, turning to
Fan, the Colonel explained that he had come to Petersburg
on business and that his sister Cornelia, who kept his
house in Washington, had accompanied him. Remembering
his visit to our neighborhood a little more than a
year ago, and desirous to see the place again, he had
suggested to his sister that they drive out from Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We started early,” he said, “and have enjoyed ourselves
immensely. Cornie is delighted with your Virginia
scenery. She is at the Golden Horn, and if agreeable to
you I will bring her to call.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Both Fan and I gasped at the thought of so great a
lady, as we felt sure Miss Cornelia Errington must be,
coming to call upon us. But we soon rallied and said we
should be pleased to see her, and then to my amazement
Fan added: “We would invite you to lunch if we were
going to have anything but potatoes, green corn, hoe-cake
and grapes. We don’t have very elaborate meals
since you Yankees spoiled us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Colonel took no notice of the last remark, but said:
“Grapes, hoe-cake, green corn and baked potatoes, the
four things I like best in all the culinary department, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>so does Cornie; we’ll come. To say the truth I did not
much like the looks of the Golden Horn. What time do
you lunch?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan told him, and then extended an invitation to Jack
to lunch with us. But he declined, and I could see a shadow
on his face as he walked away from the house, followed
soon by the Colonel, who was going for his sister.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fanny Hathern!” I exclaimed, when we were alone,
“are you crazy to ask those people here when you know
we’ve nothing fit to offer them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is good enough for us is good enough for them,”
Fan answered, proudly, starting for the kitchen and a conference
with Phyllis, while I began to put our rooms in
order for the expected visitors.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cornelia Errington, whom her brother called Cornie,
was a very handsome woman of twenty-eight or thirty,
but seemingly as cold as a block of marble, except when
she smiled. Then the whole expression of her face
changed as completely as if she had been another person.
She was born in New York, but had lived many years in
Washington, where she superintended her brother’s house.
She was highly accomplished, had traveled extensively,
knew the best people everywhere, and was in every sense
a lady. She met us very graciously, and affected to be
delighted with our rambling old Virginia house; which she
said was her ideal of a planter’s home, with its great airy
rooms, wide hall and broad piazzas.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But my papa ain’t a planter, he’s a doctor and a
gentleman,” Katy said.</p>

<p class='c014'>She had been greatly impressed with the lady’s manner
and dress and diamond rings, and evidently wished to
impress her in turn with her father’s greatness. Drawing
Katy to her and stroking her golden hair Miss Errington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>replied, “I am sure he is a gentleman, whether he is a
doctor or a farmer, and you are a dear little creature.
Was it you I heard singing in the yard before lunch?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy was always singing and so accustomed were we to
it that we seldom paid much attention, except sometimes
to wonder if it were she or the canary bird in its cage trilling
so loud and clear. Now, however, we remembered to
have heard her imitating a mocking bird just before
Phyllis, with her red turban built up five or six inches
higher than usual, announced with a low courtesy that
lunch was served. There was in the room our old piano
brought from Charleston by our mother and seldom used
for neither Fan nor I were very musical. Going up to it
Miss Errington ran her fingers up and down the keys in a
way which showed that she was mistress of the instrument.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shocking!” she said, involuntarily, then apologetically
to Fan, “I beg your pardon, but with such a voice
in embryo as that I heard outside you ought to have a
better piano;” then to Katy, “Sing to me, child, something,
I don’t care what.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Nothing could suit Katy better. She had often sang
alone in school and Sunday school, and striking her stage
attitude, as Fan called it she sang as I had never heard
her sing before, soaring up and up until she touched high
C without the slightest effort or break in her voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will be a second Patti, you sing just as I have
heard she sang when a child,” Miss Errington said when
Katy finished. Then, turning to us, she continued: “Do
you know there is a fortune in that voice. She must have
instruction; the best, too, there is to be had, and one day
you will be proud when she stands before thousands and
holds them spellbound as she has me, even with her simple
songs.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Miss Errington was evidently an enthusiast in music,
but Fan cut her short by saying scornfully, “Do you think
a daughter of Dr. Hathern would ever go on the stage?
Never! We have not fallen so low as that, poor as we are.
I’d rather see her dead.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was greatly excited, and Miss Errington looked at
her wonderingly, while Katy pulled Fan’s dress and
whispered, “What is it? What did I do? Didn’t I sing well?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, too well; never sing again,” Fan answered fiercely,
and Katy replied, half crying, “But I must; I can’t
help it; it will come; it would choke me if I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Choke, then,” Fan said, while the Colonel, who had
listened with an expression, half cynical and half amused,
on his face, now spoke and said, “Quite a tempest in a
teapot over nothing; Cornie is music mad, and the child
certainly has a wonderful voice for one so young.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Just then a robin flew down upon a sprig of honeysuckle
near the window and began to trill its evening
song; quick as thought Katy darted through the door,
and unmindful of Fan’s injunction never to sing again,
began to imitate the bird, which stopped a moment and
poising itself first on one foot and then upon the other
looked around for the fellow-songster it seemed to think
was near it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I never heard anything like it,” Miss Errington said.
“That talent must be cultivated, but she must not strain
her voice while growing. I see no reason why she should
not have as much a night as Patti, or if you object so to
the stage, there are the churches where she could command
a large salary.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As she spoke her eyes wandered about the room and I
felt sure they were taking an inventory of our faded carpet
and worn, old-fashioned furniture. She seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>me more and more like a woman accustomed to dictate
and to have her own way, and I could not rid myself of
a feeling that having once seen Katy she would not readily
forget her. The songs outside had ceased by this
time; the robin had flown away, and the child had disappeared.
Col. Errington had Fan all to himself at one
end of the piazza to which we had repaired, and I was
listening to a dissertation from Miss Errington on the
best method for removing stains and spots from old carpets
and dresses and feeling sure she had seen them in
ours and was taking this way to instruct me. We had
heard the whistle of the mail train from the east, and
twenty minutes later Black Beauty went galloping down
the lane at one side of the house with Katy on his back,
bareheaded, with her fair hair blowing in the wind and
her face turned smilingly towards us as she passed. We
were expecting a letter from father and she was going to
the Postoffice, as she often did on Black Beauty, saddleless
and sometimes bridleless, for she was a fearless little
rider and Black Beauty the most gentle of beasts.</p>

<p class='c014'>“See, Cornie, that is the pony I told you about, the one
some of my rascally soldiers stole,” the Colonel said to
his sister, who looked admiringly after the horse and
rider, saying, “Upon my word, she sits the creature well,
and without a saddle, too. She has more than one accomplishment.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will be advising us next to train her for a circus,”
Fan said sarcastically, but Miss Errington did not
reply, and went on giving me good advice until Katy came
cantering back, holding a letter in her hand and reining
Beauty up to the side of the piazza.</p>

<p class='c014'>Springing from his back and handing the letter to me
she stood holding the pony by the mane, while Miss Errington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>bent forward and began to examine him with the
eye of a connoisseur.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Really,” she said to her brother, “he is a beauty and
no mistake; I should like him for my own when we go to
our place in the country. Is he yours?” and she looked
at me.</p>

<p class='c014'>I shook my head, and nodded towards Fan, to whom
she said, “What will you take for him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is not for sale,” Fan answered, decidedly, stepping
down by the horse and winding her arm around his
neck.</p>

<p class='c014'>The brother and sister, so much alike in looks, were
also so far alike in disposition that opposition only increased
their determination to succeed. In this instance
Miss Errington was the more earnest of the two and
seemed resolved to carry her point and have Black
Beauty whether we were willing or not, and her brother
seconded her wishes. Two hundred dollars cash down in
crisp greenbacks were finally offered, and I shall never
forget the look on Fan’s face as she put it down on
Beauty’s neck, thinking intently, as I well knew, of the
many things we needed and which two hundred dollars
would buy. Of our worn furniture generally, our house,
from which the paint was gone, our shutters, unhinged
and loose, and more than all father’s darned and threadbare
coats and shocking hat, and our own dresses, made
over so many times. Two hundred dollars seemed a fortune,
and Beauty was only a luxury. Father had his saddle
horse for visiting the few patients who lived beyond
walking distance, and Black Beauty was really more ornamental
than useful to us. This was the train of thought
passing through her mind, while I watched her curiously.
Lifting her head at last she said proudly, with great tears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>standing on her long lashes, “Next to father, Ann and
Katy, I love Black Beauty better than any living thing.
You can see that we are poor enough, made so by the
war,” here her voice began to break, but she steadied it
and went on: “We need many things, but until poverty
has a firmer foothold in our house than it has now I cannot
let Black Beauty go. If a time comes when I must
part with him I will let you know; I’d rather you had him
than any one, for I believe you would be kind to him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Taking her arm from the horse’s neck she gave a
peculiar whistle, saying, “Go, Beauty, go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He understood her and went prancing down the rear
lane towards his pasture; sometimes with his heels in the
air and sometimes his forefeet, as if giving vent to his
delight at having escaped some threatened danger. I
had thought Miss Errington cold and emotionless and
was surprised at the sudden transformation in her manner
after this as she talked to Fan, who was soon herself
again, chatting gaily and repeating ludicrous and exaggerated
stories of the Colonel when he was our unbidden
guest and our place full of blue coats.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was now five o’clock and Phyllis brought in the tea
service for our five o’clock tea, a custom Fan, who was
extravagantly fond of tea, had introduced in imitation of
an English family recently come to town and with whom
we were on terms of intimacy. In our low financial state
this seemed to me a useless expenditure, but when I remonstrated
Phyllis silenced me by saying, “Lors, honey,
what’s a pinch of tea and dust of sugar, and don’t I bile
de groun’s over in de mornin’ for my breakfast. Let
Miss Fanny ’lone. All de quality in England does it, dat
big red coat at Mass’r Harwood’s say, an’ ain’t we quality,
if we is poor.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>So we had our five o’clock tea, in which Jack often
joined us, while other young people sometimes dropped in
so that the occasion was usually a very enjoyable one. This
afternoon it was especially so. With the appearance of
the china and silver teapot Fan’s spirits increased. She
liked to be “quality” quite as well as Phyllis, and did
the honors gracefully, serving Miss Errington from a red
Dresden cup which had been one of our mother’s wedding
presents, and giving the colonel a royal Worcester, which
belonged to Katy’s mother. Whether it was the pleasure
of being waited upon by Fan, or whether he was really so
fond of tea, the Colonel took so many cups that several
“pinches” were added to the pot, and the next morning
I saw a bowl full of grounds on Phyllis’s kitchen table,
but knew by the fresh, pungent odor of old Hyson which
permeated the room that she was indulging in something
more than a “bilin’ over.” After our tea-drinking the
carriage came for our guests who expressed themselves as
delighted with their call.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come to Washington and I will show you all the
sights,” Miss Errington said to us both; then to me,
“Take care of Katy’s voice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Just what the Colonel said to Fan I did not hear. He
was talking very low and looking at her with his cold,
steely eyes, which kindled as he looked and brought a hot
flush to her face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no. I don’t think I will,” I heard her say, and
that was all.</p>

<p class='c014'>After he was gone she stood watching the carriage until
it was out of sight; then said to me, “That man had the
effrontery to ask me to write to him, and he squeezed my
hand so hard that it aches now; the old idiot! I am
going to wash it.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Bouncing out of the room she ran into the arms of Jack
Fullerton, who came to say that all the grape baskets at
the vines were full and to ask if there were more to be filled.
I am afraid we were rather a shiftless lot; at least
we were told so often enough in the future—coming on
apace. We were certainly thoughtless, and while visiting
and tea-drinking entirely forgot that the baskets must be
ready that night if they went on the early morning train
to Richmond. But Jack had not forgotten, and while I
talked to Miss Errington and Fan flirted with the
Colonel, he worked steadily on, occasionally crushing a
cluster of the ripe fruit so hard that the juice spurted over
his coat as he caught the sound of Fan’s rippling laughter
and the deep tones of the man whom he began to dread
as his rival. But Fan more than made amends now.</p>

<p class='c014'>Seizing his arm with both hands and rubbing her cheek
against it, she exclaimed, “You dear old Jack, how good
you are to us, doing our work, while we entertain those
people for whom we don’t care a pin; and don’t you think,
he asked me to correspond with him!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He did?” Jack said, indignantly, and Fan replied,
“Yes, he did, and he’s forty, if he’s a day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She knew he wasn’t forty, but she was trying to appease
Jack, whose brown eyes shone with delight as he looked
at her, and who, when he thought I did not see him, tried
to raise her hand to his lips. But she wrenched it away,
and stood back from him, saying laughingly, “No, you
don’t. No man has ever kissed me except father and
Charlie and the boy, and never will until——”</p>

<p class='c014'>She didn’t say when, but Jack did not seem at all disturbed,
and that night long after I was in bed he sat
upon the piazza with her, and I heard the low murmur
of their voices and felt again the old pain in my heart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and knew that I would give years of my life for the love
for which Fan cared so little.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>A SHADOW BEGINS TO FALL.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>The letter which Katy brought us from the office was
from father, who was still in Boston and attending Mrs.
Haverleigh. She was better, he wrote, but unwilling
he should leave her until all danger of a relapse was
past, consequently we need not expect him until the end of
a week when he hoped to bring us a big fee, as his
patient was said to be very wealthy. He did not mention
Mr. Haverleigh, but of course there was such an appendage
to Mrs. Haverleigh and he would pay the bill. Then we began
to speculate as to the probable amount and what we
should buy with it. Fan decided upon new boots and
gloves; Katy was to have a doll; while I hoped she
might also have music lessons, for aside from her wonderful
voice she had a great fondness for the piano and had
already picked out a few simple tunes which she played
with a good deal of expression. Jack, who was always
included in our family councils, as if he were our brother,
laughingly told us not to count our chickens until they
were hatched, and the sequel proved the wisdom of his
advice.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the end of the week father came home, looking
fresher and younger and more erect than when he went
away. The trip had done him a great deal of good.
He had met several old friends and made some new ones.
When we inquired for Mrs. Haverleigh he did not seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>inclined to talk much of her, but in answer to Fan’s direct
question he told us the amount of his fee. He had made
her so many professional visits and received the usual city
price for each visit; fifty dollars in all. It was not a large
sum, and it went mostly to pay the little household bills
which in spite of our economy accumulated so fast. I
gave up the music lessons for Katy, while Fan called Mr.
Haverleigh a stingy old man, as she blacked her shabby
boots and mended her worn gloves.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometime in November Jack went into an insurance
office in Richmond, and life at the Elms moved in so
monotonous a groove that Fan, who craved excitement,
sometimes wished the war back upon us to keep us from
stagnating. There were one or two letters from Miss
Errington, addressed to me and full of Katy’s future.</p>

<p class='c014'>Several times the Colonel sent Fan papers and magazines
and once he wrote her a letter which she promptly
tore up, and then cried for half a day. Every week
father had a letter from Boston which he answered within
a few days. Once in passing the hall stand where he had
laid a letter while he went to his room for his gloves, I
glanced hastily at it and read, as I supposed, “Mr. Thomas
Haverleigh, No. — Beacon St., Boston, Mass.” Fan
would have taken it up and made sure of the direction,
but I only gave it a look and wondered why he was writing
to Mr. Haverleigh. He was a good deal changed
these days and he seemed silent and abstracted and I often
saw him looking at us in a wistful way as if there was
something on his mind which he hated to tell us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s money matters and the miserable bills we owe
everywhere that trouble him,” Fan said, when I spoke of
it to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, if I were rich, and could help him; and I can.
There is a way.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“What way?” I asked, and she replied, “I can sell
Black Beauty, or—myself, which is better. Isn’t it sometimes
a duty to sacrifice one’s self for others? I didn’t tell
you that Col. Errington proposed to me in that letter I
burned up! Well, he did, in an assured kind of way, as
if he thought I would be overwhelmed with the honor and
say yes at once; then, as if a doubt crept into his mind, he
told me to weigh the matter carefully before answering,
for if a favor were once refused him he never asked for it a
second time. I <em>am</em> weighing the matter carefully. I
have not answered his letter. I keep hoping something
will turn up. If it don’t I shall marry the Colonel.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what of Jack?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the mention of his name Fan flushed a little, then
replied, “I like Jack and always shall, but what can he
do, hampered with an invalid mother and only an insurance
clerk’s salary. I was never intended for a poor man’s
wife and would rather live at home in poverty with you
than in Jack’s home with his mother and old black Patsey,
who was always running away during the war and only came
back after it was over because she couldn’t do better.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no use arguing with Fan when in this mood,
and the subject was not mentioned again for months. I
knew she did not write to Col. Errington, and she did
write occasionally to Jack during the winter, which passed
rather slowly, for Lovering was never very gay at its best,
and the war had left too many aching hearts for us to be
very hilarious. Father, however, seemed in unusually good
spirits and I occasionally heard him whistling or humming
softly to himself when he was alone. When March came
round he surprised us one morning saying he was going
to Boston again on some important business which he
hoped would result favorably for us all. He did not tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>us what the business was, but when Fan asked if it had
anything to do with Mr. Haverleigh, he answered, “Not
directly; no,” and we said good-bye to him with no
suspicion of the truth. He had bought himself a new
suit of clothes, which he greatly needed, and we were very
proud of him when he put them on. We told him he looked
quite the Virginia gentleman again, and Fan came near
boxing Phyllis’s ears when she heard her muttering something
about “ole mas’r savin’ his money to pay his debts
instead of scurripen’ roun’ de country an’ makin’ a fool
of hisself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“As if our father could make a fool of himself! What
does Phyllis mean?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe he has been speculating,” Fan said to me,
“I feel sure something good is going to turn up, if we
wait long enough.”</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.—The Author’s Story.</span><br> <span class='c013'>SOMETHING DOES TURN UP.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Hathern had been gone two weeks and in that
time had written but one letter to his daughters. This was
addressed to Fanny and in it he said that the business
which had taken him to Boston was progressing favorably
and he should soon feel at liberty to tell what it was and
return home a happier and more prosperous man than
when he left it. Meanwhile his daughters were to enjoy
themselves and get whatever was needed for their comfort.
Then he added as if it were an afterthought:</p>

<p class='c016'>“By the way, I think it would be well for Phyllis to
give the whole house a regular overhauling,—housecleaning
they call it at the north, and I remember when I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>a boy that every thorough housekeeper did this twice a
year,—taking up and beating carpets, washing curtains
and blankets and paint and floors and putting the furniture
out to air. I have no doubt southern housekeepers
do the same, and it seems to me there were some such
upheavals which made me very uncomfortable when your
mother was living; but nothing of the sort has occurred
since. You were too young when your own mother and
Katy’s died to know about such things, and Phyllis, who
has been in charge so long, has not thought of it. Negroes
are apt to be slack.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Consult Mrs. Fullerton, if you don’t know what to do,
and if extra help is needed for Phyllis, get it, of course.
Tell her to take especial pains with my room. I think I
have detected a faint musty smell in it when the air was
damp. This can be remedied by beating the carpet
thoroughly and letting in a great deal of sunshine. I may
have kept it shut up too much. You will hear from me
again in about two weeks and then I shall tell you when
to expect me.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your loving father,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Hathern</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This letter Fanny read aloud to Annie, with running
comments upon it as she read.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is father growing crazy, or what has got into him to
write in such a strain. <em>Must</em>, indeed, in his room! It’s
his old boots and shoes and saddlebags of medicines
which he keeps in his closet. House cleaning twice a
year, with everything turned out of the windows! Thinks
we have never had one since mother died! Haven’t we?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie didn’t think they had, and the most she could
recall during her mother’s lifetime was a faint remembrance
of bare floors and dirt and straw and litter, and
soap and suds and discomfort generally, with a scurrying
here and there of negroes with Phyllis at the helm; then a
great quiet, with the fireplaces full of green boughs and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>peonies and snowballs and herself and Fanny told not to
put their little soiled fingers on the window panes because
they had just been washed. This was very far back, and
neither Annie nor Fanny could remember any housecleaning
since so extreme as that. Certainly there had been
none since Katy’s mother died, and Phyllis had managed
the household. In short, as they confessed to each other,
they were rather easy-going young ladies, who, accustomed
to many servants before the war, had fallen into the habit
of leaving everything to Phyllis. And that functionary was
very willing to have it left to her, and waited upon them
and petted them and scolded them alternately with all the
freedom of an old and trusty family servant.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the days of slavery there had been no more valuable
negro in Lovering than herself, and she knew it, and prided
herself upon it and the respectability of her ancestors
generally as proven by the fact that there was not a drop
of white blood in her veins.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’d be ashamed if there was, and blush for my mother.
Black is a good color, which wears well, and I thank de
Lord I am as black as a Guiney nigger,” she said; but
she was equally proud of the fair faces of the twins and
little Katy, whom she loved as if they were her own.</p>

<p class='c014'>She had nursed them when they were babies; had walked
the floor with them many a night when they were teething
or had the colic; had drawn them miles and miles
from cabin to cabin in a baby cart—proud of her twins
and proud of herself as “Mas’r Hathern’s nigger, who
was worth more’n a thousand dollars, and who he wouldn’t
sell for nothin’;” she had closed the eyes of both her mistresses,
and prepared them for the grave. She had comforted
the two little motherless girls with cake and honey
and a most wonderful rag doll, and taken the new-born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>baby, Katy, to her bosom and bed. She had tried to run
away with a part of the Federal army, but found that she
could not, so great was her love for her master and his
family. She was a part of them, or rather they were a part
of her, and after she assumed the entire management of
the household she owned them just as they once owned
her, and sometimes ruled them more rigorously than she
had ever been ruled.</p>

<p class='c014'>In this condition of things it was natural that the young
ladies should settle down into a state of listless dependence,
allowing her to do what she pleased and when she pleased,
and giving but little thought to what was done or left undone,
provided they were comfortable and the general look
of the house was neat and tidy. At long intervals she
had her times of “clarin’ up,” when the house was full
of brooms and brushes and mops and clouds of dust and
the odor of soap suds. On these occasions, in a petticoat
patched with many colors, which stopped half way between
her knees and her feet and a knit jacket left by one
of the soldiers, Phyllis would march from room to room,
rating the young ladies soundly for the disorderly condition
in which she found them, and wondering what their
poor mother would say if she knew how they slatted
their things and left them for her to pick up, when every
bone in her old body ached. But if they tried to help
her she spurned their offers disdainfully. She reckoned
she knew what “de quality ought to do, an’ it wan’t for
her young misseses to sile dar white hands, when dar was a
big pair of black ones, made to soil and spin. What did
cussed be Canan mean if it wan’t that the blacks was to
sweat an’ slave and have der bad times in dis world an’
de whites der good, an’ in de nex’ <em>wise wersa</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Phyllis was great on theology and powerful in a prayer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>meeting, where she could be heard for nearly a quarter of
a mile, when she was moved by the <em>sperrit</em> to let herself
out. Naturally her arguments prevailed when she brought
forward the Bible to prove their validity, and Annie and
Fanny usually succumbed and let her have her way.</p>

<p class='c014'>Occasionally when she wished to try some fancy dish
Fanny made a raid upon the kitchen, greatly to the discomfiture
of Phyllis, who fluttered like a hen when its
brood of chickens is disturbed, while a close observer
might have thought she was fearful of having something
discovered which she wished to hide. But Fanny knew
better, and after the time she found the nutmeg grater in
Phyllis’s pocket and the rolling pin, which had been lost
for two or three days, on the floor under the table, she
abandoned the kitchen, and the old negress was left
monarch of all she surveyed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, however, there must be a general cleaning,—a
thorough overhauling,—and Fanny was deputed to notify
Phyllis, whom she found eating her dinner on a stool outside
her cabin door, her turban somewhat awry and her
usually good-humored face clouded over as she shoo-ed
the chickens and screamed at the dog, which from an
adjoining garden had strayed into her domains.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A reg’lar overhaulin’, wid de carpets all up and
whaled, an’ de furniture turned out of do’ to a’r, an’ his
room smellin’ of musk,” she said, when Fanny told
what her father had written. “Is Mas’r Hathern ’sinuatin’
that I’m dirty, an’ I sarvin’ him so long an’ faithful?
I wouldn’t have ble’ved it,” and her voice trembled and
her head shook till her turban was displaced and took an
upward turn, as it was wont to do when she was displeased.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a saying of the young ladies that they could tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Phyllis’s state of mind from the height of her turban, and
when Fan saw it begin to lengthen she knew there was
a storm brewing, and braced herself to meet it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who’s to take up dem carpets an’ wallop ’em, and
put ’em down again I’d like to know. Last time I clar’d
up I done cotched such a misery in my back and laigs that
I’ve had rheumatis’ ever since, and I didn’t hist up de
carpets nuther.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny explained that she was to have help, but this
only brought out a snort from the old woman, who went
on: “Extra help, as if I was an onery nigger like old
Patsey. An’ for de Lord’s sake whar’s de money to come
from to pay de help? Mas’r can’t pay de bills now, unless
he sells me, an’ sometimes I think I’ll ’vise him to do
dat an’ get out of debt.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you are free. We can’t sell you, and wouldn’t if
we could; that is all in the past,” Fanny suggested.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dat’s so; more’s de pity,” Phyllis rejoined, and went
on to say that she reckoned she wan’t so old yet that she
couldn’t wallop a carpet and put it down, if her knees
were not too stiff and she should do it, too; and begin
the next day; help indeed, when she was ’round.</p>

<p class='c014'>By this time the Fullerton chickens were on the strawberry
patch again and the Fullerton dog had his nose in
the refuse pail, which he finally upset. But in her excitement
Phyllis did not notice it. She was too intent upon
the housecleaning, which was commenced the next morning
with a vengeance, and without the slightest system
or order. Every room and closet from cellar to garret
was turned upside down, with carpets up and furniture
out, and not a spot where one could sit and be comfortable.
They ate on the pantry shelf and slept on the floor
while the worst of the pandemonium continued. True to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>her determination Phyllis <em>walloped</em> the carpets herself and
did it so effectually that one of them, the oldest and most
tender was <em>walloped</em> into tatters and could not be used
again. When it came to putting them down Phyllis gave
out. Her knees would not bend, and her back and arms
were too lame, while not a negro was to be found willing
to help. Fortunately in this emergency Jack had an off
day, which he spent with Fan-and-Ann, who pressed him
into service. Arrayed in one of Phyllis’s clean turbans
and aprons, and armed with hammer and nails, he attacked
the carpets vigorously and with the help of the young
ladies and with a great deal of joking and fun they were
put down as few carpets were ever put down before,—crooked
and puckered, and loose, while Jack had a blood
blister on his thumb and Fanny a bruise on her knuckles,
where she struck them with the hammer, and Annie a
headache, which lasted two whole days. But they were
down and seemed very fresh and clean, as did the entire
house when Phyllis was through with it and free to nurse
her swollen arms and hands, the result of so much lifting
and carpet beating. The odor of must, if there had ever
been any, had disappeared from the Doctor’s room, with
his old boots and saddlebags. As it was his carpet which
had been beaten to tatters, its place had been supplied
with some light, pretty matting bought at a reduced rate
at a forced sale.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish we could afford a new chamber set, too,” Fan
said, looking ruefully at the high post bedstead, with its
canopy and valance, and at the bureau and chairs older
than she was, as they had come from the south with her
mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>But this was out of the question. The family purse
was too low. The chamber set was given up. The post
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>bedstead, with its feather bed, was made high and soft,
and the best white counterpane put upon it. There were
clean covers upon the bureau and square stand, where
the Book of Psalms, which the first Mrs. Hathern had
used, was still lying, and with it a prayer-book which had
belonged to Katy’s mother. Fan brought a pretty pin
cushion from her room, with a slipper case and tidy, and
when all was done, called Phyllis to see the effect.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mighty fine and invitin’;” Phyllis said, “’pears like
you’re expectin’ a bride, te-he-he.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The laugh had in it a sound of sobbing, rather than of
merriment, and Phyllis’s turban was slightly elongated as
she went back to her work. All her insinuations, however,
were lost upon the daughters, who, with no suspicion
of her meaning, sat down to enjoy the quiet and freshness
of their home, daily expecting a letter telling when
their father was coming to enjoy it with them.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.—Annie’s Story.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE SHADOWS DEEPEN.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>After a ten days’ siege the housecleaning came to an
end, with no worse disaster than the entire demolition
of one carpet, literally beaten to death,—the breaking of
one or two windows, a caster split off from a bureau, and
a cupboard with dishes in it knocked flat in our attempts
to move it. Phyllis had a “misery” in her back and we
were all more or less afflicted with colds we had caught
during the upheaval. But we had a heap of fun with
Jack, who helped us out, and the house was clean, or we
thought it so, and only father’s presence was needed to
make us quite happy again. But he did not come and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>didn’t write. Every morning we said “we shall hear
from him to-day,” and every night a fresh disappointment
awaited us, for he neither wrote nor came, and in our
anxiety we were beginning to think of telegraphing to his
address in Boston and inquiring if any thing had happened
to him. It was Fan who suggested this one morning,
about a week after the cleaning was over.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait one more day,” I said, “and if we do not hear
to-night we’ll telegraph to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was now past the middle of April, but the day was
cold and cloudy, and late in the afternoon the rain began
to fall, softly at first like a gentle April shower, but
gradually increasing until by the time we heard the train
from the east and Fan started for the office it was a regular
downpour, which beat against the windows and ran in
great streams from a defective eaves-trough over the door.
In all lives there are some days which so impress themselves
upon our minds that the minutest detail is never
forgotten, but comes to us over and over again, with the
joy or the sorrow which wrote itself so indelibly upon our
memories. Such a day was this, and as I write I hear
again the soughing of the wind through a great pine tree
which stood in a corner of the yard, and the rain sifting
down upon the turf beneath it, and see the blaze from
the pine knots which Phyllis had lighted on the hearth,
and as the blaze leaps up, filling the room with warmth
and light I see at my side Katy’s golden head bent over
the picture-book she is reading, while one of her small
white hands rests upon my lap. In the kitchen I hear old
Phyllis crooning a well-known melody, consisting mostly of
inquiries as to the whereabouts of the Hebrew children,
as she prepares our evening meal.</p>

<p class='c014'>During father’s absence we had dispensed with our six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>o’clock dinner and contented ourselves with lunch and our
five o’clock tea, but this night I had ordered a substantial
supper, with a vague presentiment that father might surprise
us, and I can smell the savory dishes as I smelled them
then and feel the same appetizing sensation which they
brought to me. As the light and heat from the pine knot
increased and the flames went rolling up the chimney in
graceful curves, the faces of the dead looked at me from
the blaze,—faces of the boy in grey and the boy in blue
whose graves were on the hillside. That of the boy in
blue was the more distinct, and I saw again the great
sunken blue eyes which had turned to us so wistfully as
the pale lips pleaded that we would not “let them get
him,” or “let her find him.” We knew whom he meant
by <em>them</em>, and were reasonably sure that the <em>her</em> was the
Aunt Martha, for whom neither Fan nor myself entertained
a great amount of respect.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, as I watched the fire,—half asleep it may be,—and
saw alternately the faces of my brother and the <em>boy</em>, Aunt
Martha came also and stood before me on the hearth,—a
tall thin woman of the New England type, with firm-set
lips and hard, unsympathetic eyes, which never softened
a whit when I questioned her of “the boy,” and
asked why she had never come to inquire for him before,
and who was the Carlyle he had spoken of so kindly.
Just as she was about to answer me Katy started up exclaiming,
“There she is,” and I awoke to hear the sound
of voices outside.—Fan’s voice, and with it another which
always made my heart beat faster, although it never
spoke to me except as a brother might speak to his sister.
Jack had come home that evening and Fan had met him
and brought him with her, and they came in laughing
and chatting merrily, and shaking the rain drops from
their umbrellas and wraps.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“How perfectly delightful that fire is,” Fan said, holding
one of her wet boots near it to dry, and bidding
Phyllis bring a plate for Jack and hurry on the supper,
as she was nearly famished. “I have a letter from
father,” she continued, as we drew up to the table, “but
it will keep till after tea.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We were a very merry party, as we always were when
Jack was with us, for he had the happy faculty of knowing
how to bring out the best of everybody. He had
been promoted and his salary increased, and he was in
high spirits, as we all were, and not one of us dreamed
of what was in store for us, when, as Jack asked me for
his third cup of coffee, Fan, who had finished her supper,
said, “If you are going to drink coffee all night and don’t
mind, I’ll see what father has written.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She took his letter from her pocket; looked at it very
leisurely; opened it carefully with a knife, as if afraid of
spoiling the envelope, and then began to read it. I was
pouring Jack some hot coffee, which Phyllis had just
brought in, and did not look at her until Jack startled me
by saying, “Why, Fan, what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I turned to her and saw that her face was nearly
as white as the letter over which her eyes were traveling
with lightning speed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fanny, Fanny,” I exclaimed; “what is it? what has
happened? Is father ill, or dead?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Neither,” she answered, in a voice very unlike herself.
“Neither ill nor dead, as you mean it; but dead to
us. He is to be married to-night at eight o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment everything turned black around me, and
I might have fallen from my chair if Phyllis, who was
standing near me, had not put her hand upon me as she
said, “Surmised it all ‘long. I done tol’ you so.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Neither Fan nor I paid any attention to her then; we
were too intent upon the letter, which Fan at last read
aloud and which ran thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>

<p class='c016'>“I am very glad that I can at last tell you something
definite with regard to the business which brought me to
Boston, and which will soon be happily completed. You
remember the Mrs. Haverleigh whom I attended last fall
through a dangerous illness? Well, the admiration I conceived
for her then has since ripened into what, if I were
a younger man, I should call love.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Love!” Fan repeated, scornfully. “Love! and he
almost sixty years old. If he were not my father, I’d call
him a fool!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No fool so big as an old fool!” came explosively from
Phyllis, whose turban seemed bristling with rage as she
spoke out exactly what was in my mind.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You here?” Fan said, angrily. “Go away about
your business.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Phyllis did not budge. She was a part of us.
What concerned us concerned her, and in this crisis she
meant to stand by us and learn the best or worst there
was to learn.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where was I?” Fan asked, and Jack, who did not
look as disturbed as I thought he ought, suggested,
“Love!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes: ‘ripened into love.’ Ripened into fiddlesticks,”
Fan said, and read on:</p>

<p class='c016'>“When I left home I was not quite certain as to the
result of my errand, but I am now. Mrs. Haverleigh has
consented to marry me on Thursday evening of this week
at eight o’clock, and I am writing this in the hope it may
reach you that evening, and that you will send me your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>congratulations, in spirit at least. Mrs. Haverleigh is a
remarkable woman,—very fine-looking, and about forty,
I imagine, although she does not look it. I have never
asked her age. She has traveled extensively,—is well
educated, and belongs to some of the best families of New
England. Indeed, I believe she traces her ancestry back
in a direct line to Miles Standish of the Mayflower.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I never could bear Standish. What business had he to
think of Priscilla when he had had a Rose?” Fan said, with
an upward tilt of her nose. “Best families in New England!
Humbug! as if that made her any better. Don’t
we belong to some of the best families in the south?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she read on:</p>

<p class='c016'>“She is a member of several clubs and societies, and
has most excellent ideas with regard to bringing up children.
In this respect she will be invaluable in training
little Katy, who I think manages herself mostly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t want to be trained,” Katy interrupted, with a
whimper.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you are not going to be trained either,” Fan
said, drawing the child close to her. Then she added:</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let’s see what other virtue this paragon possesses.
Oh, yes:”</p>

<p class='c016'>“She is also, an incomparable housekeeper,—thorough
in every thing, and will relieve you of all care.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hm! I didn’t know we had any care; Phyllis takes
all that,” Fan said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dat’s so, honey,” came from Phyllis, who was standing
behind her, stiff as a stake, while Fan continued:</p>

<p class='c016'>“She is wealthy, too, and inclined to be very generous
with me. She knows my circumstances perfectly, and
how the war impoverished us, and has made over to me
more than enough to pay my debts and have something
left.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Very unmanly in father to take her money. I must
say I am disappointed in him in more ways than one,”
was Fan’s next remark, before continuing:</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not yet understand why she is willing to leave
her handsome house in Boston and come to our plain,
run-down home, but she is, and as soon as possible she
will have sent to us a part of her furniture, together with
her cook and housemaid and probably a coachman. This
will be a great help to Phyllis, who is getting old, and
who, while she does well for us, can hardly meet the
requirements of a Boston housekeeper.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“For de Lord’s sake, has ole Mas’r done gone perfec’ly
daff over dat widder? Me getting ole! who knows how ole
I am? I don’t, nor Mas’r either. What for dat woman
bringin’ white trash down har to boss me? I not stan’
it!” Phyllis broke in with a flourish of the knives and
forks she had in her hand, one of which flew off at right
angles and came near hitting Jack in the head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Got it,” he said laughingly, as he picked up the knife
and replaced it on the table, while Fan turned to Phyllis
and said, “You here yet? Didn’t I tell you to leave long
ago?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, honey, but I’s har jess de same, an’ I’s gwine to
stay, too, an’ spress my ‘pinion of dis yer Massachusetts
woman fotchin’ her truck whar I’s sarved this forty year,
an’ never started to run away but onet, when de sojers
tell me de fine stories of freedom. What does I want of
freedom? Nothin’. I’d be sold down de river to-day to
sarve you, but I won’t be,—what you call it,—trampled on
by dem whites. No, sir!” and here she turned to Jack,
shaking her fist at him. “No, sir! An’ shoo’s you bawn,
ef dey tries it, dar’ll be wah! Yes, <em>wah</em>! Wus than t’other,
an’ dis time it’ll be de Federates an’ not de Fed’s who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>beats. Bet your soul on dat. Now I’ve had my say;
I’se gwine.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She nearly shook off her turban, which stood up almost
a foot as she marched out of the room, followed by Jack’s
hearty, “Three cheers for Phyllis! Good for you!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is there more?” I asked, as Phyllis disappeared, and
Fan continued:</p>

<p class='c016'>“We are going to New York and Washington, and shall
reach home in ten days or two weeks at the most. Will
telegraph you when to expect us. I need not ask you to
receive your new mother cordially and kindly. As ladies
and my daughters you can hardly do otherwise. You will
love her when you know her. I should like you to call
her mother, but if you feel that you cannot, I shall not
insist. Katy, of course, will address her as mamma. She
has never had a daughter and will take to the child at
once. She has a son who is now at Andover, but who
will spend his summer vacation with us. He is fifteen or
sixteen,—a fine, handsome lad, with all the polish and
manner of twenty-five. He seems delighted with the prospect
of having sisters. He calls you that already and is
especially desirous to see little Katy, whose photograph I
have with me and have shown him. He is here this evening
and sends his love, and says tell you he expects a great
deal of pleasure with you in the summer. His name is
<em>Carl</em>. Mrs. Haverleigh, also, wishes to be kindly remembered.
If you care to write to me, direct to Ebbett
House, Washington.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Lovingly your father,</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“<span class='sc'>Samuel Hathern</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>After the reading of the letter there was silence for a
few moments, broken only by the sound of the rain which
was still falling heavily, the crackling of the pine knots on
the hearth and the ticking of the clock. Glancing up at it
at last Fan said, “They were to be married at eight. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>is a difference of time between Boston and Richmond.
The ceremony is over, and we have lost our father.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she began to cry and I cried with her, while Jack
tried to comfort us, telling us to look on the bright side,—that
it might not be so bad after all. We had had one
stepmother and loved her, and we might love another.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That was very different from a Boston woman, who
belongs to clubs and societies and has views, and all that,”
Fan said. “We did love Katy’s mother. She was like us,
and didn’t want to turn the house upside down with her
raging housekeeping, as this woman will. She was easy-going,
and she gave us Katy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Putting her arm around the little girl, Fan drew her
closely to her with a gesture as if shielding her from some
threatened danger. Assured that she was not to be
<em>trained</em>, Katy looked upon the marriage rather favorably,
and smoothing Fan’s hair caressingly, she said, “Don’t
cry, the new mother will be nice, and then there’s brother
Carl. I am so glad for him. I’ve wanted a brother ever
since Charlie died, and after you told me to pray for what
I wanted, I did pray, first for a doll that shut its eyes,
and I got it,—then for a hoop, and I got it,—and then
for a boy-brother, and we’ve got him. I get everything
I want.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy’s faith in prayer was very strong, and Fan, who had
taught her this faith, could not discourage it now, although
wishing that her prayers had taken some other object than
a boy-brother.</p>

<p class='c014'>That night on our way to bed we stopped for a moment
at father’s room, the door of which stood open. In the
winter, when there was no company in the house, it was
really our living room, where most of our evenings were
spent. Our father liked it warm when he came in at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>night, and there was always a bright fire on the hearth, with
his arm-chair and slippers on one side, and next it the
stand, with his book and paper and spectacles upon it, for
he often read aloud to us, with Katy’s bright head resting
on his knee, while Fan and I sewed, or embroidered, sitting
on the settee rocker opposite him. This was all over
now. A stranger had come between us, who would sit
by father’s side while his children shifted for themselves.
Some such thoughts as these were in our minds when we
stepped into the room which we had taken so much pains
to make attractive for his home coming.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish we had let it alone,—<em>must</em> and all,” Fan said.
“I am glad we couldn’t buy a new chamber set. Let
her bring her own, as I dare say she will. I mean to take
my pink pin cushion away. I didn’t put it here for <em>her</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But she left it. I knew she would, as she always subsided
into quiet after a storm. We sat up late that night
talking the matter over, and decided finally to make the
best of it for father’s sake and never let him, nor any one
but Jack, know that the new wife was not acceptable. We
couldn’t deceive Phyllis, however, nor console her either,
and for two days she went about the house with the tears
dropping from her nose and running down her cheeks.
“It was not so much the missus she ’jected to,” she said,
“though it was bad enough to be sot on and bossed around
by a stranger when she had been fust so long. It was the
po’ white trash comin’ down with their a’rs that she
couldn’t stan’, an’ wouldn’t. She’d run away fust! an’ if
they sot the dogs on her she’d drown herself in the river;
then see how ole mas’r’d feel when they brought her
home drownded like a rat!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Notwithstanding there was nothing to run from Phyllis
was always threatening to run when disturbed or displeased,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>but had never contemplated suicide before, and now, in
her pity for herself and for us when she should be fished
from the river, limp and dead, she forgot the new mistress
in a measure, and on the second day asked if she hadn’t
better wash the windows again in <em>master’s</em> room. The
marriage was generally known by this time, but no one
congratulated us and few spoke of it at all. Evidently, it
did not meet with approbation. Always perverse and
contradictory, this silence on the part of our friends made
Fan angry, and turned the tide in favor of the stranger.
“Father had a right to marry if he chose, and the
neighbors were very impudent to object,” she said, and,
greatly to my surprise, she began to evince a good deal
of interest in the coming of Mrs. Hathern. To Katy the
new mother was to be <em>mamma</em>, but to us, Mrs. Hathern,
and it seemed to me Fan took special pains to repeat the
name as often as possible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am trying to get used to it, but oh, how I hate it
all. I’ll not let people know though,” she said to me,
with quivering lips, and then she broke down and sobbed
hysterically, declaring that she’d run away with Phyllis
and drown herself, or marry Col. Errington. She hadn’t
answered his letter yet, but she would that very day.</p>

<p class='c014'>Possibly she might have done so if the post had not
brought us a letter mailed in Andover and directed in a
large boyish hand to “The Misses Hathern.” It was
from Carl, who wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Fanny and Annie and Katy</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I am awfully glad that you are my sisters, and I am
going to tell you about the wedding. I was there and
saw your father endow my mother with all his worldly
goods and heard her promise to obey him. She won’t do
it, though, you bet. They mostly never do, I guess, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>mother least of all. They seem happy as clams; so I suppose
old people can be in love as well as young. I
shouldn’t like mother to know I said that. She’d be mad
as a hornet. She thinks she’s young, but she will be forty
next birthday. She is a very handsome woman though.
I never wanted mother to marry. She has had offers as
thick as huckleberries, and I kicked at them all until I
saw your father, and then I gave in and told her that she
might. I like him immensely and I’m going to like you,
especially little Katy, she’s so lovely. Your father showed
me her photograph, and finally gave it to me, I begged
so hard. I’ve shown it to the boys, and made them green
with envy by telling them of the good times I am to have
next summer in the Virginia woods and hills and in the
old house with you. I hate the city, and like the country,
and always wanted to go south. I was sorry I was not old
enough to enlist in the army;—not to shoot anybody,
but to see the country. I suppose you were rebels. Well,
that’s right. I should have been, too, if I had been born
south; but I’m a northerner, and yelled myself hoarse
when I heard our men were in Richmond. I was in the
country, and I and a lot more boys stole so many dry-goods
boxes and barrels and wood for a bonfire that one
old copperhead, whose chicken coop we took, had us
arrested. Between you and I,—you and me, I mean,—I
don’t believe your father is more than half a reb, or he
wouldn’t sit so quiet and hear mother rake the south.
She’s peppery. I said to her it wasn’t good form, and
she told me to shut up, and I shut! I generally do when
she tells me to.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I wish you’d write to me. I like girls immensely,
and they like me, but only one has ever written to
me, and that didn’t count. It was Julina Smith,—mother’s
maid,—two or three years older than I am. I’m
fifteen. She is rather spoony, and made me a pair of slippers
and sent them to me with a letter in which she called
me ‘Dear Carl,’ and ended with ‘Your loving Julina.’
The slippers were well enough, if she wanted to give
them to me, but the <em>loving Julina</em> was a little too much. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>tore the letter up, and when I went home and she made
eyes at me I told her to <em>dry up</em>, and she <em>dried</em>. I believe
mother intends taking her to Virginia, and if she does you
will have to <em>set on her</em>, I can tell you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is nearly class-time and I must stop. I am studying
Greek and Latin and a lot more stuff, and expect to
enter Harvard when I know enough. And now, in the
words of the divine Julina, or <em>Julienne</em> as she’d like to be
called, seeing there’s French blood in her,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yours lovingly,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>“<span class='sc'>Carl Haverleigh</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“P. S. I guess you’ll like me. Girls generally do,
although they say I am fickle and pretend a lot I don’t
mean. But I mean it at the time. I can’t always keep
up to concert pitch when the concert is over, nor keep
smelling a rose after its perfume is gone. Now that
sounds rather poetical and neat, don’t it?</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yours again, <span class='sc'>Carl</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This letter, over which we laughed till we cried, helped
to turn our thoughts from the dreaded stepmother to the
bright, frank boy, whom we felt sure we should like, during
the concert, at least, and while the perfume of the
rose lasted. Fan read most of the letter to Phyllis, who,
at its commencement, stood with her hands on her hips,
her elbows elevated and her nose in the air. But before
its close her nose and elbows came down and a broad smile
broke over her face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bress de boy!” she said. “‘Pears like mas’r Charlie,
only in course ’taint to be ’spected he’s so peart-like
seein’ he’s from de norf, whar dey’s all so onery.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, Phyllis,” Fan said, “he is from Boston, and
must have a heap of Boston culture.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s dat ar?” Phyllis asked, but Fan did not explain,
and left Phyllis wondering if Boston culture was
‘<em>catchin</em>’.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.—Author’s Story.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE COMING OF THE BRIDE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The two weeks which Dr. Hathern had mentioned as
the longest possible time before his return were nearly
up, and his daughters were daily expecting some message
from him telling when he would be home. They had become
somewhat accustomed to thoughts of the new mother
and the new order of things she was to inaugurate, and
felt that there might be some compensation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It will be rather fine to have a posse of servants,—white
ones, too,” Fan said. “We shall quite outshine
the Lovering people with our style. Coachman,—that
means carriage and horses,—cook, maid, besides Phyllis,
who, I suppose, will be the laundress. That will give us
all the white skirts and dresses we want. I dote on white
skirts.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan was rather luxurious in her tastes and would have
liked nothing better than fresh white skirts and linen
every day, and would have had them, too, but for her
compassion on Phyllis, who usually had a “fetched misery
in her back” on Monday, and a worse one on ironing
day, if there were too many <em>frillicks</em>, as she called them,
in the wash. The prospect of new furniture was not, on
the whole, displeasing, although they were greatly attached
to the solid old-fashioned things which had belonged to
their mother. Still it would not be out of place to excel
their neighbors, inasmuch as they were what Phyllis termed
the “fustest family in town.” On the whole, they began
to feel quite reconciled to the marriage, and took a good
deal of pains to make the house as attractive as possible
for the bride. They had Phyllis’s word that it was as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>clean as soap and water and her two hands could make it,
and as they never thought of peering into corners they contented
themselves with little changes here and there,
which they thought were artistic.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was now May and the garden was full of early flowers,
with which they meant to brighten the rooms at the last.</p>

<p class='c014'>A letter had come from Miss Errington, who had noticed
among the arrivals at the Ebbitt House the names of
Dr. Samuel Hathern and wife, Lovering, Va., and as she
knew there was but one Lovering in Virginia, and but one
Dr. Samuel Hathern in Lovering, she felt sure it was their
father with a new wife and had ventured to call.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They received me in their private parlor,” she wrote,
“and I was charmed with your father. Such a genial,
courtly gentleman of the old school and so proud of his
bride. She is a very handsome, well-preserved woman,
and is <i><span lang="fr">au fait</span></i> in everything pertaining to etiquette,—and
knows how to dress perfectly. She has a good deal of
Boston manner, and I should say decided views on most
things. I imagine there may be a little Scotch blood in
her, which accounts for a certain accent in her speech.
She seems to be well educated, and, like myself, is very
fond of music. Indeed, she is quite up in that, and,
remembering little Katy’s wonderful voice, I spoke of it
and said I hoped she might have every facility in the way
of music. She assured me she would see to it, and what
she says she means; there is no doubt of that. On the
whole, you are to be congratulated on having a superior
woman for a stepmother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a good deal more of irrelevant matter, with
one or two allusions to her brother, who was about going
abroad on business. But over this the sisters passed
hastily. Their interest centered in the mother.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Scotch descent,—Boston manners and views. I knew
she had <em>views</em>,” Fan said, with a toss of her head. “She
is woman’s rights and runs an abolition society, I dare say,
or did before the war. Fine musician; I wish Miss Errington
would mind her business about Katy. I wonder what
madam will think of our old rattle-trap of a piano. Very
likely she will bring us a Steinway or a Chickering.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This letter, instead of reassuring the sisters, made them
rather uneasy with regard to the cultivated woman with
views. What would she think of them, who had scarcely
been outside of Lovering, and who knew so little of the
world?</p>

<p class='c014'>“I reckon I shall hate her, after all,” Fan thought, as
she began to pull herself together and to remember sundry
acts of abandon and bits of slang in which she sometimes
indulged and which would be hard to give up.</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie, on the contrary, who never shocked anyone, and
whom her sister called a flat iron, or a flat, from her propensity
to smooth matters and make the best of them,
began to feel again her old dread of the new mother and
to wonder how one so inferior as herself would impress so
much superiority. The next day there came a telegram
from their father, who was in Richmond and would be
home the following evening at six o’clock. There was
also a letter from Jack, who wrote hurriedly:</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Fan-and-Ann.</span> <i><span lang="la">Veni, vidi, vici.</span></i> Brush up your
Latin and translate, but make it third person, with <em>she</em>,
instead of first. To be brief: I called at the Spotswood
this evening, and looking over the register, as I often do,
saw in your father’s handwriting ‘Dr. Samuel Hathern
and wife, Lovering, Va.’ In a jiff I sent up my card,
and in another jiff I was shaking hands with Mrs. Hathern,
who received me as if I were her son, or brother, and nearly
looked me through with those eyes of hers which see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>everything. Whether they are black or blue, white or
gray, I can’t tell, but I think they are black. You
can’t get away from them; they follow you like the eyes
of some portraits I have seen,—my grandmother’s for instance,
which hangs in our dining-room. I never could
steal a lump of sugar or poke my thumb into the honey
pot because she was always looking at me. Just so with
Mrs. Hathern. She lights on you and holds you and
seems to be going clear down to a fellow’s boots and reading
his inmost thoughts. She is handsome and stylish
and had on the best fitting dress I ever saw. Looked as
if she were run into it. I’ve no doubt she is a blood
relation of Miles Standish and all the other chaps who came
over in the Mayflower. She is very dignified but not
exactly like our Southern ladies. Maybe it is her voice,
which is strong and full and decided, and would make you
jump if you were doing anything bad. To-morrow I am
to have the honor of driving with her around the town and
showing her the nakedness of the land, and I assure you
it is very naked. I could shed buckets full of tears over
the ruins of our once fair city, but it’s no good crying for
spilt milk. Better go to work and get some more. She
wishes to go first to Libby Prison. Think of it! I a Reb,
and she a Fed, hob-nobbing in that place. She must
have forgotten herself when she said to me with so much
concern in her voice, ‘I trust you were never so unfortunate
as to be a prisoner there.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“I think even Fan would have been pleased with my
dignified manner as I replied, ‘Madam, I had the honor
to wear the grey, and there was no possibility of my being
a prisoner in Libby.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘Oh, I beg your pardon,’ she said, with a look which
made me feel like a cut-throat and murderer, and as if I
ought to have been in Libby, or some worse place, all my
life.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then her eyes lighted up and a most wonderful smile
broke out over her face, changing its expression entirely.
I think that smile must have won your father. It made
even me feel kind of so-so,—queer-like, you know. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>seems very proud and fond of her. Calls her ‘Matty,’
and once when she thought I did not hear her she called
him ‘Sam’!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Disgusting!” Fan exclaimed. “Sam! our father,
Dr. Hathern! Sam, indeed! I knew she was vulgar,
with all of her Standish blood. Sam! The idea!”</p>

<p class='c014'>After this Fan had scarcely patience to finish the letter,
which had but little more in it of the bride.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next morning the young ladies were up betimes.
As a rule they were not early risers, especially when
their father was away. Nine and even ten o’clock sometimes
found them in bed, while Phyllis kept their breakfast
warm and made no signs of protest, unless there was
a greater amount of work than usual and she was very
tired. Then to herself she would call them <em>onery</em> and
<em>shiffless</em>, and wonder what their poor mother would say if
she knew how no-count they were, lyin’ bed hours after
sun up. The morning after the receipt of the telegram,
however, they were up with the sun and found Phyllis preparing
the most appetizing breakfast she could think of,
and occasionally wiping away a big tear before it dropped
from her nose.</p>

<p class='c014'>“De po’ lambs should have one more meal in peace
before the missus come,” she said, as she served her cream
toast and corn muffins and urged them to eat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy was the only one who did justice to the muffins and
toast. Fanny and Annie could only make a pretense of
eating, and when breakfast was over Fanny said with a
hysterical laugh, “I am going to the graves to tell mother
and Charlie and the boy who is coming to-day. I don’t
believe they know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A moment later she was walking rapidly across the field
to the hillside cemetery, where she staid for a long time.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>What she said to the dead, if anything, no one ever
knew. When she came back there were traces of tears
on her face, but otherwise she was calm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you know,” she said to Annie, “that the boy
seems very near to me this morning. I can see his great
blue eyes looking wistfully at me as they did when he said
‘Don’t let her find me.’ Do as I will, they follow me as
if they wanted to tell me something.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie was accustomed to her sister’s theory that the
dead are cognizant of what interests us, and only shivered
a little as she replied, “I am glad I am not haunted with
dead eyes. It is enough to think of the living ones which
Jack says see everything, and will be sure to know if these
rooms are not in order.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie, who was more practical and more housewifely in
her instincts than Fanny, was already at work and had
brought from the garden and yard quantities of flowers,—roses
and peonies and snowballs and lilies,—which lay
heaped upon the dining-room table, with every vase and
bowl and available pitcher in the house. Fan’s forte was
decoration, and she at once went to work with a will,
fashioning the flowers into bouquets and whistling as she
worked, sometimes Dixie, and sometimes John Brown’s
Body, which last she said was probably the bride’s favorite.
If the boy’s eyes haunted her they acted as a stimulant,
urging her on until the house was full of flowers and
odorous with perfume. The last room visited was Charlie’s,
where the uniforms of grey and blue were hanging,
over one the stars and stripes,—over the other, the stars
and bars. This was a sacred spot. Fan never whistled
there, nor sung, and she stepped softly and spoke low as
she put the bowl of forget-me-nots on the stand under the
faded coats, where the bloodstains of Charley and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>boy were showing. It seemed to her that many eyes were
upon her now, and she began to feel nervous as she gently
patted the pillow over which Charlie’s head used to lie,
and where the boy’s had lain when he shouted a <em>tiger</em> for
her and died.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor boy!” she said to herself, as she left the room,
“Had you no friends, and shall we never know who you
were, or where you came from?”</p>

<p class='c014'>After the early dinner they laid the table for supper,
bringing out the best linen and china and glass, wondering
where the mother would choose to sit that first night. It
had been Annie’s prerogative to preside over the coffee
urn. This must, of course, eventually be given up, and
might as well be done first as last. So the Dresden plate,
the one pearl handled knife and fork, both heirlooms
from their grandmother, and kept mostly to look at, were
put with the tea-cups and saucers, and the arm-chair their
mother and Katy’s had used was wheeled to its place.
For a moment both Fanny and Annie stood by it with a
hand upon it, while Annie said, “I wonder if mother
knows or cares.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Knows! Yes,” Fanny replied, “but does not care.
In Heaven they neither marry nor are given in marriage,
so, what is it to her if father brings home as many
wives as the Mormons,—four at once, I have heard. It
is only we that care.”</p>

<p class='c014'>When everything was in readiness the sisters went all
over the house, feeling a kind of pride in it, with its wide
hall in the centre, its two large rooms on either side, and
its broad piazza, shaded with honeysuckles, clematis and
woodbine, and a beautiful wild rose or eglantine, struggling
with the three and throwing out masses of color against
the dark leaves of its neighbors. It was an ideal Virginia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>home, and the Boston woman, with all her culture and
views and advanced ideas must find it so, the sisters
thought as they finished their inspection and sat down to
wait for the train. Katy, who had been as much interested
in the preparations as any one, had made two small
bouquets which she put on her father’s bureau, with a card
under each. On one was scrawled in a child’s almost
illegible hand, “For papa, from Katy;” on the other,
“From Katy to Mamma.” She was happy, and in her
white dress and blue sash, with her fair hair falling around
her shoulders in soft curls she made a lovely picture as
she flitted from room to room, now consulting the kitchen
clock, now the one in the dining-room and wondering if
they would never come. At last the whistle was heard in
the distance coming nearer and nearer and finally ceasing
as the train drew up to the station. Fifteen minutes passed,
seeming to the sisters an age, and the village ‘bus
stopped at the gate, followed by the express wagon on
which were two huge Saratoga trunks, a large valise and
a hat box.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ought we go and meet them?” Annie said, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” Fan replied. “It is enough for Katy to go.”</p>

<p class='c014'><em>She</em> was running down the walk, and with a glad cry
threw herself into her father’s arms. Then, at a word
from him, she gave her hand to the lady at his side, who
stooped and kissed her. It had never yet occurred to her
that every body did not love her and want her, and she
held tightly to the lady on one side and to her father on
the other, and so went hippity-hopping up the walk, telling
them that the old cat had six kittens and the speckled
hen thirteen chickens; that the house was beautiful with
roses and things, and she had made two bouquets herself.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>It was a very cold, callous heart which could withstand
Katy, and Mrs. Hathern’s face wore a soft and pleased
expression as she looked down at the little girl and then
up at the two young ladies who had come out upon the
piazza and whom the doctor presented to her as “My
daughters, Fanny and Annie.”</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.—The Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>MRS. HATHERN.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>She had taught a district school in a small town in
Maine,—had been preceptress in a young ladies’ seminary
in Calais,—a music teacher and organist in Portland,—and
the wife and widow of Thomas Haverleigh, of Bangor,
whom she had married mostly for his money, and for the
broader field it would give her. Some years after his
death she moved to Boston, where her restless, energetic
nature found full scope in the many clubs and societies of
which she became an active member. Her marriage with
Dr. Hathern was a surprise to her friends, who knew how
unlike the two were to each other. He was gentle, refined,
wholly unselfish and rather weak where decided action
was necessary; she strong, determined, and self-assured,
with a will which no one could bend except her son Carl,
and he sometimes failed. There could scarcely have been
two people more unlike and possibly this dissimilarity of
disposition was what attracted each to the other until both
believed they were in what the lady called a middle-aged
kind of love. In a letter to a friend she likened it to the
Indian summer, which is often more satisfactory than the
fervid heat of the real summer days. Whether it were
Indian summer or June the doctor did not stop to consider.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>He was infatuated and only knew that he was supremely
happy and never more so than when he reached home
and was presenting his bride to his daughters. They
were nervous and constrained, but she was wholly at her
ease, while her eyes, which Jack said saw everything, did
not belie his statement. They were very large and black
and bright and took the two girls in at a glance, from
their heads to their feet, making them feel rather uncomfortable.
Fanny thought with some uneasiness of two missing
buttons on her boots, while Annie remembered a little
rent in her underskirt and wondered if it were visible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am glad to see you and hope we shall be friends.
Which is Fanny, and which Annie?” Mrs. Hathern said,
and her voice seemed to fill the whole house, it was so
distinct and decided, with a tone in it which some might
call an accent, but which Fan-and-Ann pronounced a
brogue, when comparing notes with regard to it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Had she been a public speaker she could have thrown
it into the farthest corner of the largest hall, but her hearers
would not have said it was a pleasant voice. It was
too self-assured and too full of a conviction that the opinions
it expressed were the only opinions worth expressing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Like most cold impassive natures she was not at all demonstrative
and although quick to see and speak of whatever
was wrong, or out of place, she seldom praised or
expressed herself pleased with anything. That she made
no comment was, she thought, a sufficient proof that she
did not disapprove. <em>Gush</em> was especially distasteful to
her, and she was glad not to meet it in her step-daughters.</p>

<p class='c014'>She knew they must be nervous, but they were ladylike
and quiet and received her kindly. They told her which
was Fanny and which Annie, saying laughingly, “we are
better known as <em>Fan-and-Ann</em>.” One took her satchel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the other her shawl, as they led the way into the house
and showed her to her room. Fan, who was watching her
closely, saw how rapidly her eyes traveled from one object
to another, lighting finally upon an immense spider’s web
in a corner, which had probably been there a week, as
there were two or three dead flies already in it, and a
freshly captured fourth was making a loud protest against
its capture.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can I do anything for you?” Fan asked, with a view
to draw attention from the offending web.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, thanks, I can get along quite well by myself,”
was the reply, and acting upon the hint the girls left her
alone and went to their father, who was seeing to the
baggage, and whom they nearly knocked down as they
seized him around the neck and smothered him with kisses.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why—why—why; bless my soul! What’s all this
whirlwind for? and crying, too,” the Doctor said, folding
them in his arms and feeling his own eyes moisten a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We didn’t half tell you how glad we are to have you
home, and we don’t mean to cry,” Fan said; “and we
are not going to again; but just this little minute I can’t
help it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes; there, there,” the doctor replied, patting
first one head and then the other, “there’s nothing to
cry about, I assure you, except for joy. She’s a very
remarkable woman, and the wonder is that she could care
for an old codger like me. We are going to be very happy,
all of us. She has some elegant furniture coming, which
will make the old house quite like a palace. You know
you have wanted new furniture a long time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, father,” Fanny cried. “We would rather have
you than all the fine furniture in the world; but we are
going to be good; indeed we are.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>She was hugging him again with her arms around his
neck on one side of him, while Annie’s were on the other,
when they were startled with a call for <em>Sam</em>, which came
echoing down the hall like the peal of a clarionet, making
the four clinging arms drop suddenly, while the doctor
struggled into an upright position and answered, “Yes,
Matty, I am coming.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Hathern had removed her bonnet and investigated
the room, deciding, with a radical woman’s quickness
what changes she would make when her furniture
came; deciding, too, that the windows had not been half
washed and the window stools not at all, judging from
the dust and dried leaves upon them. Then with her
umbrella she demolished the big spider’s web and was
proceeding to attack a smaller one in the vicinity of the
bell rope, which she tried with no effect, when Katy came
dancing into the room, her blue eyes showing the admiration
she felt for her new mamma, whose grey dress and
steel buttons she began to finger caressingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I like you,” she said and moved by an impulse she
could not resist Mrs. Hathern stooped and kissed the
lovely face with something like a real mother feeling in
her heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>But nothing could change her nature, which was to discipline
and mould whatever needed moulding and disciplining.
So, when Katy, wishing to call attention to her
gift of flowers, said to her, “Have you seen my flowers.
I give ’em to you.” She answered promptly, “You mean
you gave them to me. Little girls must learn to use good
grammar. Yes, I see them; they are very pretty, but be
careful or you will upset the vase and spill the water;
better run out now, while I make my toilet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was not so much the words as the tone with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>they were spoken, which brought a slight shadow to Katy’s
face as she started for the door, followed by Mrs. Hathern,
who looked out into the hall in time to see the tableau
at the farther end.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not as emotionless and impassive as I thought,” she
said to herself, understanding it perfectly, and interrupting
it with her call for Sam. She was given to the use of
pet names; she had called her first husband Tom, and knew
no reason why she should not call her second Sam. At
first he rather liked it. He had been Sam when a boy,
and it made him feel young again. But when he heard it
in the presence of his daughters, it sounded differently,
for he felt their disapproval of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can’t open my satchel,” she said, when he came to
her. “Something is wrong with the lock, and how can
I get some hot water. I have tried the bell three times
with no response.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In her voice there was something the doctor had not
heard before, and, like Katy, he felt a passing shadow on
his spirits, but he hastened to undo the lock of the satchel
and said, apologetically: “Oh, yes, the bell. I knew the
cord was broken. I will see to it at once, and the hot
water, too. I’ll go for Phyllis to fetch it, I haven’t seen
her yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He found Phyllis in a mood which could not be described
as angelic. She had spent an hour or so in clearing
up her kitchen; had mopped the floor; shoved into
dark corners pots, kettles, skillets and brooms, and arrayed
herself in her red flowered gown and white apron, with
her highest turban on her head. If her master had come
alone, she would have gone with his daughters to greet
him, but with a new mistress it was not to be thought of.
“She reckoned she knowed her place,” she said; “whar she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>was raised niggers didn’t put on no a’rs. Marster would
done fotch the new Misses to her, in course.” But as
time went by and neither mistress nor master appeared,
her wrath began to wax hot and to manifest itself in her
own peculiar way.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Whar is the use,” she reasoned, “clarin’ up an’
hidin’ things whar I can’t find ’em, if my lady is too fine
to come inter de kitchen. No, sir! I’ll jess have ’em
handy agin.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Pots and kettles and skillets were brought from their hiding
place and set down promiscuously on the hearth. The
broom and mop followed next, and the duster was aimed
at the door behind which it belonged, just escaping contact
with the doctor’s head as he appeared. He had heard
from his daughters of Phyllis’s propensity to throw things
when on what they called a rampage, and concluded she
was on one now.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ho, Phyllis,” he said in his cheery way. “What’s
up, and why haven’t you come to welcome your new mistress?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He offered her his hand, which Phyllis grasped firmly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’se mighty glad to see you, Mas’r,” she said, “an’
I’se gwine to do my duty, but for de dear Lord’s sake whar
was de sense for a new Misses. Et kind of upsots one to
think of dem t’others what’s dead an’ gone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was the first real set-back the doctor had received,
and it hurt his pride that his servant should disapprove
of what seemed to him so desirable. But in his
usual kind way he soothed the old negress, who assured
him again that she meant to do her duty and <em>bar</em> everything
for his sake and the young misseses. Filling a
pitcher with hot water, which took a few minutes to heat,
she followed him to his room, where Mrs. Hathern stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>with a hint of a cloud on her face at the long delay, and
because the pitcher had a broken nose and a suspicion of
pot black on the handle. She prided herself on never
losing her temper to the extent of showing it in her
voice or manner. In a quiet, determined way she could
sting with her tongue and smile while she did it. Bowing
graciously to Phyllis she said, “I thought perhaps you
had forgotten the hot water, and I have washed me in
cold, but you can leave the pitcher, and please wipe off
that black spot which you probably did not see.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Phyllis explained, as she rubbed off the pot black, that
“de water bilin’ in de tea kettle was hard as rocks and not
fit for ladies to wash in, an’ she had to blow up the fi’ to
heat some soff.” Then, putting the pitcher down with a
thump she bounced out of the room. She had taken Mrs.
Hathern’s measure, and Mrs. Hathern had taken hers,
and neither was very satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She ain’t no mo’ like Miss Carline or Miss Nellie
than I’m like Mas’r General Lee,” she said, and there
was a stormy look in her eyes when she went in at last to
wait upon the table, where Mrs. Hathern presided as
easily as if she had all her life sat in the arm-chair she
was the third to occupy.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was a woman of theories and maxims to which she
adhered rigidly. Among these were, “Early to bed and
early to rise,”—“An hour in the morning is worth two
at night,” and so forth. Accordingly, the next morning
at six o’clock she was out upon the piazza looking very
cool and handsome in her gown of lavender and white,
open in front to show her embroidered petticoat as was the
fashion of the time. Everything about her dress and
person was spotless, and she impressed one with the idea
that she had just been scrubbed and ironed. Her hair was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>never out of place; her collars and cuffs never soiled, or
her garments crumpled or torn. Cleanliness she held
next to godliness, and shiftlessness and untidiness next to
sin. Born and reared amid the thrift and energy and
activity of New England, she had no idea of or sympathy
with the happy-go-lucky manner of living in the Hathern
family, with Phyllis at its head. Hearing no stir, and seeing
no signs of life in the dining-room, except a few flies busy
with some crumbs left on the cloth the night before, she
found her way to the kitchen, where Phyllis was very
leisurely making preparations for breakfast. Later on,
before presenting herself at the table, she was intending
to don her Sunday apparel, but now, as the morning was
very hot, her dress might be described as decolleté.
A faded calico skirt, which scarcely reached her bare
ankles, and a loose, thin sacque which showed all the
creases and curves of her portly figure, comprised her
entire make-up as she stood with her back to the door,
stirring her batter for griddle cakes, and all unconscious of
the foe bearing down upon her.</p>

<p class='c014'>With a warning cough Mrs. Hathern stepped across the
threshold, so startling the old negress that she dropped
the egg she was about to break into the batter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, my Lord, how you done skeered me,” she exclaimed,
lifting both hands, in one of which was the dripping
spoon. “Does you want anything, honey?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Phyllis was very religious, and a leader at the meetings
held in some of the freedmen’s cabins, where pandemonium
usually reigned and the Lord was entreated as if he were
deaf, or asleep. She had attended one of these the previous
night, and on her way home had told a crony whom
she met how she had <em>rassled</em> in pra’r, and had asked others
to rassel, too, that she might have grace to do her duty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>As a result of her <em>rassling</em> she was in quite a conciliatory
frame of mind, and the word <em>honey</em> came from her involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am not one of the young ladies, I am Mrs. Hathern,”
the latter said, holding up her dainty skirts as she
walked around the broken egg and the pots and kettles
which Phyllis had not yet put away. “What time do
you usually have breakfast?” she asked, and Phyllis replied,
“Oh, we ain’t perticular, mos’ any time when dey
gits up,—eight, nine,—sometimes ten,—jess as happens.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Hathern looked aghast. Such habits as these she
was not prepared for, and she would not allow them either.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well,” she said, “that may have answered in
the past; for the future we will have breakfast in the summer
at seven, sharp,—and at eight in the winter.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In Phyllis’s astonishment the second egg, which she
had brought from the cupboard, was in danger of following
its companion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In de Lord’s name, how’s you gwine to git de young
ladies up, or marster, either so airly. Why, it’ll take a
hoss team to do it,” she said, and Mrs. Hathern replied,
“I shall see to that, and you will see to the breakfast
until my cook comes, when she will take your place.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Phyllis bridled at once and her turban began to topple
on one side. But she remembered her duty, and asked,
very respectfully, “When is she comin’?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very soon, I hope, and a housemaid with her,—both
capable servants, who are accustomed to keep everything
in order. The sight of your kitchen would drive them
crazy. Do you always cook by a fireplace? Have you
no stove?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Phyllis snorted,—a sure sign that she was forgetting
her duty.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Stove!” she repeated. “One dem squar’ black
things, a burnin’ and blisterin’ your han’s! No sir! Ole
Miss Fullerton done got one before de wah, and dat fool
of a Rache buil’d de fi’ in de oven, an when de smoke
an’ de fi’ bust out, she screeched so dat Mas’r Hathern
went over an’ put it out, an’ tole ’em whar to make de fi’.
He’s from de norf, whar all such truck as stoves comes
from, an’ he larf fit to split his sides when he seen de fi’
in de oven. No, sir! No stove for me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Such shiftlessness!” was Mrs. Hathern’s mental comment,
as she went back to the piazza where she found her
husband, and sat down to wait for breakfast with what
patience she could command and to think how she could
best change the habits of this “sozzling household.”</p>

<p class='c014'>That was what she called it in the first letter she wrote
her son, telling him to go at once to her house and expedite
the departure of Norah and Julina. He was also
to order the best range in Boston and have it sent to her
immediately, with all necessary furnishing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Think of a big fireplace,” she wrote, “with a crane
and tin ovens and pots and kettles and spiders and the
water pail, with a gourd on the top, all in a clutter, and a
huge negress, weighing at least two hundred, standing in
the midst, with nothing on but a short petticoat and loose
sacque! That is what I found the first morning when I went
to the kitchen to see if breakfast were ready. We didn’t
have it until eight o’clock, and that was too early for Miss
Fanny, who did not appear until we were nearly through.
I have ordered it for seven hereafter. I cannot begin too
soon to change the loose habits the girls have acquired
from having had so many blacks to wait upon them before
the war, and depending wholly upon Phyllis since. She
almost breathes for them, and they let her. To do her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>justice she looks very respectable when she comes into
the dining-room and she waits at table remarkably well.
It is a very pleasant, roomy house, with wide verandas
above and below, broad hall in the centre, with fireplace
in one corner, and doors opening at either end. But it is
greatly run down,—old, faded carpets and rickety furniture—and
in the bedroom I intend for you a broken-legged
bureau, propped up on a brick. We should call this
second class at the north, but they are really among the
first people in the town, and don’t seem to know how dilapidated
they are, or if they do they are too proud to
show it. I refer now to the girls. The Doctor admits
that things are not quite as they ought to be. He is a
thorough gentleman, and I am more and more convinced
of the wisdom of my choice. Fanny and Annie are bright,
pretty girls, especially Fanny, who is the ruling spirit and
mouth-piece for her sister. Katy, the youngest, is a beauty,
but spoiled. I do not think she knows what restraint is,
but I must restrain her, and mould her as a child should
be moulded. She will then make a splendid woman. The
twins are, I fear, beyond my control. Fanny certainly
is, and there is a fire in her black eyes I should not care
to rouse. I forgot to tell you that there is a wide lawn
in front of the house, with a long avenue leading to the
street, shaded with elms and maples. The garden is full
of flower beds bordered with old-fashioned box, and there
are roses and honeysuckles and running vines everywhere.
In the rear a grassy lane leads to the woods, which at
times during the war were full of soldiers, both northern
and southern. The war still broods like a plague over
Virginia, although I cannot help feeling that some of the
people make it an excuse for what is only the result of
years of indolence and indifference to anything like thrift
and energy.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Carl’s answer to this letter was prompt and characteristic.
“I went to the house,” he wrote, “meeting Julina
in the street. She informed me that Miss O’Rourke was
giving a lunch to some of her friends, and had sent her
after oil for the salad. So you see, ‘when the cat’s away
the mice will play.’ Norah seemed as meek as Moses when
she saw me, and if a lunch was in progress she gave no
sign of it. Perhaps Julina lied; it’s like her. Miss
O’Rourke informed me that after getting the house ready
for the new tenant, she must visit her grandmother and
‘rest up’ before going south, and Julina will ‘rest up’
with her. So I don’t know when you will see their ladyships.
What a delightful picture you give of the Elms.
Double piazzas, wide hall, big rooms, avenues, gardens,
roses and woods, to say nothing of pots and kettles and
pans and a 200-pounder, all huddled together in the
kitchen, and a bureau propped up with a brick! I like
that. It reminds me of our first visit to the sea shore,
with a cottage full of broken furniture, and so leaky that
when it rained we had to set with washtubs over our
heads. What a field you have in which to exercise your
executive ability and love of change; but don’t go to
bossing little Katy, or make her sit in chairs and go to
bed without her supper, as you did me, and don’t introduce
that new order of ‘early to bed and early to rise’
until I have had a chance to enjoy the old easy-going
régime you hold in so much contempt. Let the girls
sleep, if they want to. I remember how you used to
snake Paul and me out of bed at the most unearthly hours
until he ran away, and I got weakly and the doctor told
you I must have all the sleep I could get. How I hated
the early bird which caught the worm, or rather the worm
for getting up to be caught. I am going to like the girls,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and shall probably fall in love with all three; that’s my
way, you know. Perhaps Katy is too young. Eight isn’t
she? while the twins are eighteen. I am nearly sixteen,
am five feet ten and trying to raise a beard. Not an
infant, you see.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This letter was not altogether satisfactory to Mrs.
Hathern, whose usual smooth brow was somewhat wrinkled
and whose voice and manner had an increase of energy
and decision when she went back to the posse of negroes
at work in different parts of the house. There was a great
upheaval in progress, which Annie, who was an eye-witness
to it in all its details, will describe in another chapter.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX.—Annie’s Story.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE UPHEAVAL.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>My coadjutor, the Author, has told how the new
mother came home to us on a lovely May afternoon, when
we had made the old house bright with flowers and
schooled ourselves to receive her as our father’s wife
should be received by his daughters. We had heard she
was a remarkable woman and a handsome woman, and
we were not disappointed. She was handsome, with the
brightest and blackest eyes I ever saw,—dark, glossy
hair,—not one of which ever dared get out of place,—brilliant
complexion and regular features, if I except her
nose, which inclined upward a little, and her chin, which
receded in proportion as her nose went up. And she
was remarkable, too, and so different from any type of
woman we had ever seen that she took our breath away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and for a few days we were in a state of collapse and bewilderment.
She was a highly educated woman, bristling
all over with views and theories and maxims, one of which
was “never to let the grass grow under her feet, if there
was anything to do.” And she didn’t let it grow, but
plunged at once into the midst of a domestic cyclone,
which not only swept away for the time being all our comfort,
but, also, the good opinions we had entertained of
ourselves as housekeepers and young ladies of judgment.</p>

<p class='c014'>We had never dreamed that we were as shiftless and no
account and dilapidated a set as we came to believe ourselves
in the new light shed upon us and our surroundings.
We knew that our furniture was old and our carpets worn,
but we had a pride in and an affection for them because
they had belonged to our mother, and we thought the
house was clean, and we told Mrs. Hathern so when she
suggested a regular tear up such as was customary in
New England twice a year. For answer to our assertion
that we had been scrubbed from attic to cellar she smiled
a pitying kind of smile at our ignorance, and rubbing her
hand over the top of a door brought off an amount of black
which appalled us. We had never thought of looking
on the top of doors for dirt. But her eyes went everywhere,
and she went with them and wrote against us
“weighed in the balance and found wanting.” Everything
was wrong, especially in the kitchen, where, she
said, Norah O’Rourke would not stay a day. Privately,
Fan and I thought she was more than half afraid of Norah
O’Rourke, whom she quoted so constantly and for whom
it seemed to us our hitherto quiet house was turned inside
out. Two carpenters were brought into the kitchen,
where an extra window was cut so that Norah O’Rourke
could have more light and air; a new cupboard was built
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>for Norah O’Rourke’s iron utensils, which Phyllis had kept
anywhere, so that they were handy; there was a sink for
Norah O’Rourke’s dish-washing, and stationary tubs for
Norah O’Rourke’s laundrying. The ceiling was whitewashed;
the walls painted a light drab and the floor snuff
color, and when everything was in readiness for Norah
O’Rourke, except the range which had not come, that
lady’s quarters were certainly a great improvement upon
the dark, dingy room where Phyllis had reigned supreme
so long.</p>

<p class='c014'>Just what her position in the household was to be when
Norah O’Rourke arrived we did not know, as Mrs. Hathern
was reticent on that point. That she didn’t like
Phyllis, and Phyllis didn’t like her, was an assured fact,
but there was as yet no open rupture between them.
Mrs. Hathern was evidently trying to control her temper,
while Phyllis was conscientiously striving to do her duty.
I think she <em>rassled</em> in <em>pra’r</em> at the night meetings a great
many times during the toss up, which extended from the
kitchen to the house proper, where, as Fan wrote to Jack,
“The old Harry held high carnival.” Had I then read
Jane Carlyle’s life and letters, as I have since, I should
have sympathized with her fully in her despair and discomposure
when her lord came home full of bile and
raised Cain generally. As it was with that house at No. 5
Cheyne Row, so it was with our house under the Elms.
Carpets came up, curtains came down, furniture was banished
to the attic to make room for the new that was
coming. Paper was torn from the walls and lay in long
mouldy strips upon the floor. Pails of suds, with mops
and brooms and brushes and four colored women who
had been pressed into service in order to expedite matters,
were everywhere, together with plumbers and painters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>and upholsterers and paper-hangers brought from Richmond
to assist in the mélee.</p>

<p class='c014'>In her cambric dress and white apron, which never
showed a particle of soil, and a dainty little cap, with a
lavender bow, perched on the top of her head, Mrs. Hathern
moved among her forces like a brigadier-general,
urging them on as they had never been urged before in
their lives. The women, however, baffled her. They were
not accustomed to the Yankee quick step, and if she left
one washing a window while she went to look after
another, she was very apt on her return to find the window
washer setting in a rocking chair or rummaging through
a bureau drawer. Dire were the complaints she made
about the blacks. She was a rank abolitionist during the
war, she said, but if she had known what a good-for-nothing
race they were, she shouldn’t have troubled herself
about them, and she’d like nothing better now than to
thrash them if she could. But they were free and her
<em>ekles</em> one of them told her during a hot controversy over a
window which was washed three times before it suited.</p>

<p class='c014'>Had there been nothing except a battle between Boston
energy and Virginia slowness, Fan and I might have enjoyed
it, knowing that out of the confusion order would
finally come, but a more serious matter was daily confronting
us in the shape of little Katy’s misdemeanors. We
never knew before that she had any, but now we found
that of all children to get into mischief and tear
her clothes she was the worst. She enjoyed the commotion
and was always in the thickest of it. Naturally she
soiled her dress and apron and hands, for which she was
promptly reproved and punished. Sometimes she was
made to sit for an hour or more in a high chair near the
bureau in father’s bedroom. For diversion she was told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to commit either the collect for the day, or several verses
in the Bible, beginning with the sermon on the mount,
the number of verses varying according to the heinousness
of her offense. Sometimes, if the rent in her dress
were longer and the soil worse than usual, she was sent
to bed and kept there until morning supperless, unless
Phyllis surreptitiously conveyed a paper parcel into her
window by standing on a stool and using a pitchfork.
Once, when overcome with sleep, she fell off the chair
and was only saved a hard blow on her head by the open
Bible which fell under it. Then Fan interfered, and holding
the sobbing child in her arms appealed to her father,
asking if so much discipline were necessary.</p>

<p class='c014'>During the war father had never been quite sure on
which side he stood, and now he was equally undecided,
until Mrs. Hathern said, in that cool, rasping voice, which
always irritated me, “My dear, I am sorry to be the cause
of any trouble between you and your daughters, but really
you must decide at once which is to take charge of Katy,
Miss Fanny or myself. The child is a dear little creature,
but needs restraining. Sitting in a chair, or lying in bed,
does not hurt her physically. I always corrected Carl
that way, and——”</p>

<p class='c014'>She stopped suddenly as if she had left some name
unsaid, and it seemed to me that she flushed a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>Her hand was on father’s arm rubbing a speck of dirt
she saw there, as she waited for his answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, certainly, certainly,” he said, hesitatingly, “Katy
is our baby, and I suppose we have spoiled her; naturally
it is a mother’s place to take charge of her. Be as easy
with her as you can, and you, Katy, be good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So Katy was ordered back to the chair until she had
committed all the Blesseds which she did not already know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>in the sermon on the mount. There was only one of these
and she was soon at liberty, and as she had the sunniest
nature I ever knew she was in a few minutes at her play
again under the Elms, making believe she was in church
singing the grand old Te Deum with that clear, wonderful
voice which made the workmen stop to listen, while Mrs.
Hathern said to us, “Miss Errington was right. Katy has
great capabilities. I know something of music myself,
and when my piano comes I shall take her in hand.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“May the Lord help Katy if the madam takes her in
hand more than she has already done,” Fan said to me
when we were alone and she could give vent to her wrath.
“I tell you what it is, father is an imbecile and she is a
tyrant, and I won’t stand it. I’ll marry Col. Errington.
You’ll see.”</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter X.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>A SUSPICION.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>It was five weeks since Mrs. Hathern came home, and
late June was queening it over the woods and hills of
Lovering, and the lawn and the garden were full of flowers
and beauty. The house, with its new coat of paint, was
quite another place from the one we had known from
childhood. Then it was brown and weather stained;
now it was white, with green blinds, and looked very
clean and fresh and cool in the summer sunlight, with
the luxurious vines clinging to its sides and the huge columns
of the piazzas. Inside the change was greater
still. Plumbers, painters, upholsterers, carpenters and
negroes had departed. The furniture had come and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>scarcely knew ourselves with our carpets of Brussels and
moquette, our sofas and chairs of brocade and rosewood,
our long mirrors and lace draperies, and, more than all,
the costly paintings which in their Florentine frames
adorned the walls of the drawing room and hall. We were
very fine, and our neighbors came in crowds to see and
admire and congratulate us upon our prosperity. Mrs.
Hathern had plenty of money and spent it lavishly upon
us all, and there is no doubt that we were really greatly
improved in every way by the introduction of Boston
standards and Boston ways. But on Fan’s part and
mine there was always a regret for the good old easy-going
times when things were at haphazard and we did
as we pleased, with no one but Phyllis to dictate to us.
She was still doing her duty, but doing it in a cabin across
the back yard. The range had come and had been set
up, and Mrs. Hathern had done her best to initiate Phyllis
into its mysteries. But either she couldn’t or wouldn’t
learn, and in despair she had been allowed to carry her
pots and kettles and skillets and ovens to the cabin, where
there was a fireplace in which she could potter as she
pleased, until the arrival of Miss Norah O’Rourke, who
understood the range in all its ramifications. She was
still visiting her grandmother and <em>resting up</em>, but she was expected
in a few days, together with Julina, in whom Fan
and I felt considerable interest as the girl who had made
love to Carl. He, too, was expected soon and had sent on
a box containing a most heterogenous collection, which
he had called his Lares and Penates,—fishing tackle, bathing
suits, an air-gun, a student’s cap, sporting pictures cut
from sporting papers, old books and photographs, and some
handkerchiefs and gloves which were never bought for
him and in which there still lingered a delicate perfume,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>whole not worth the cost of the express, his mother
said.</p>

<p class='c014'>But she unpacked them carefully and put them in his
room, the pleasantest bed-chamber in the house and the
one we had always used for guests. This she appropriated
without consulting us. Indeed, she had never consulted
us but once and that, with regard to the disposition of
some of the old furniture, the piano and the pictures of our
mother and Katy’s. These last had hung in father’s room,
where he could see them the last thing at night and the
first thing in the morning, and we had prided ourselves
upon them because they were fair likenesses of the sweet-faced
women who had once reigned as mistresses at the
Elms and because they were our only oils.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They may be good likenesses, but they are badly
done,—mere daubs,” Mrs. Hathern said, when calling our
attention to them by asking where we would like to have
them put. The space they occupied was wanted for her
own portrait, life-size, taken in Paris and gorgeous in
cream satin, low neck and pearls. “Three Mrs. Hatherns
in one husband’s bed-chamber are too many,” she said,
and we agreed with her and removed the daubs to our
own room, where we were sitting when Carl’s box was
being unpacked.</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy was looking on and prattling constantly, while her
stepmother occasionally reproved her for being so curious
and asking so many questions. Something was wanted
from below stairs and Mrs. Hathern went to fetch it, leaving
Katy alone. A moment after the child came running to
us with two photographs which she had found in a book.
One, the freshest and newest, was that of a bright, handsome
boy of twelve or thirteen, with a happy, laughing
expression in his brown eyes which told of a sunny disposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and perfect content with life as he found it. The other
was the picture of a boy two or three years older, with something
the same features, but a worried, anxious expression
as if life were not all a holiday. That they were related
we were sure, and that one was a poor relation we felt
equally sure.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Carl,” I said to Fan, indicating the younger face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, Carl,” she answered, but her gaze was riveted
upon the other,—the sad, browbeaten face,—whose great
wide open blue eyes looked into ours with a wistful, pleading
expression we had seen somewhere and could not
recall. “Who is he, and what makes me feel as if I were
looking upon some body dead?” Fan asked just as the soft
swish of Mrs. Hathern’s gown was heard and she appeared
at the door, saying in the low tone which always made
Katy shiver and think of the high chair, “Katy, did you
take two photographs from Carl’s room?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, mamma. I wanted to show ’em to Fan and
Ann,” Katy said, reaching her hand to us for them.</p>

<p class='c014'>I gave mine up, saying as I did so, “This I am sure
is Carl. He is a very handsome boy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Fan kept hers, fascinated by the mournful eyes
which held her as the Ancient Mariner held his unwilling
hearer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, this is Carl, and he is a handsome boy,” Mrs.
Hathern replied, taking the photograph from me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And who is this?” Fan asked, surrendering hers at
last.</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not think of it then, but it came to me afterwards
that Mrs. Hathern’s voice was not quite natural as she
replied, “That is Carl’s cousin Paul, who once lived with
us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where is he now?” was Fan’s next question, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Mrs. Hathern replied, “I don’t know. I think he is
dead. He went to the war, and never came back.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She left the room and we were alone, as Katy had
already gone. We were sitting near an open window looking
north, and simultaneously our eyes went across the
field to the hillside cemetery where the headstones of
Charlie and The Boy showed white amid the growth of
flowering shrubs and fragrant evergreens; then they came
back and confronted each other with a questioning look
of terror and surprise. Fan was the first to speak. Leaning
forward she whispered to me, “Mrs. Hathern is Aunt
Martha!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” I said. “She <em>is</em> Aunt Martha,” and I felt
myself grow faint and sick as I said it.</p>

<p class='c014'>We had conceived such a contempt for the woman
whose image had haunted our dying boy’s pillow that the
shock was very great when we learned that she was with
us, a part of us, our father’s wife. We felt more and
more sure of it as we recalled the few words The Boy had
dropped with regard to himself. When we asked his
name he had said he was one of the Apostles, and that was
Paul. He had spoken of a Carlyle as younger than himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>That was Carl, and there seemed nothing wanting to
complete the chain of evidence except to know Mrs.
Hathern’s real name. From the window we saw father in
the lane mounting his horse preparatory to visiting a patient.</p>

<p class='c014'>Slipping down the back stairs Fan went up to him and
after stroking the horse’s neck a moment said, “By the
way, father, what is Mrs. Hathern’s real name? You call
her Matty. Is it Matilda?” “No, child, Martha. I
thought you knew,” was the reply, and in a moment Fan
was back again, pirouetting around the room and beating
the air as if she were crazy.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“She is Aunt Martha!” she exclaimed. “I don’t
wonder he said he would never go back to her. How
long do you suppose she kept him sitting in chairs like
she does Katy?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Until he was glued to them,” I answered, and she continued,
“It is horrible, horrible! I think I hate her.
What will she say, I wonder, when she knows that Paul
died here with us? And she shall know it. Snowdon’s
knight never longed more earnestly to stand face to face
with Rhoderic Dhu than I long to tell her The Boy’s
story.”</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter XI.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>AUNT MARTHA.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>There were two halls on the upper floor of our house,
one long and wide and running from north to south, the
other, shorter and narrower, turned off at right angles, running
east and west. Opening from this hall was Charlie’s
room in which no change had been made since The Boy
died. Three or four times a year Phyllis washed the linen
and made the bed up fresh and clean, while Fan and
I swept and dusted the unused chamber, which had become
a kind of Bethel to us. If Mrs. Hathern had
attacked it during the upheaval we were prepared to do battle.
But she did not, and with no suspicion of the danger
threatening it we were going down the narrow hall to an
outside piazza when we saw the door open and heard
voices inside, Mrs. Hathern’s and Phyllis’s, the latter
pitched high as if in fierce altercation, and the former
low but very determined. Crossing the threshold we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>found Phyllis, straightened back with her hands on her
hips, her usual attitude of defiance, and her turban nearly
off her head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You can’t have dis yer room,” she was saying. “It’s
Mas’r Charlie’s, and whar the Boy died; dems de berry
piller slips he died on; nobody has done slep here since
and neber will till de day of judgment. Thar’s ’nuff
oder rooms plenty good for July or any other white truck
from de norf.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is all this?” Fanny asked, addressing Mrs.
Hathern, who replied, “I am glad you have come to teach
this insolent negro her place. I am not accustomed to
such opposition from a servant, and cannot allow it. I am
wanting a room for Julina, who will be here in a few days.
This suits me. But when I told Phyllis to clear it up and
remove those old soldier clothes, which are only gathering
moths, she refused outright and commenced a rigmarole
about Mas’r Charlie and some <em>Boy</em> which I cannot comprehend.
Perhaps you can enlighten me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turning to Phyllis Fan said, “You can go. I will explain
to Mrs. Hathern.” Then to the latter, “I am sorry
that Phyllis should be disrespectful to you, but she is right
about the room. No one can occupy it. It was my brother
Charlie’s and the Boy’s, whose memory is almost as
dear to us as my brother’s. These which you call
old clothes were Charlie’s. You know, perhaps, that he
was killed in the war.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She had crossed the room and was standing by the uniforms
of blue and grey, one with the stars and bars above
it, the other with the stars and stripes. Mrs. Hathern
bowed stiffly and said, “I have heard so, yes; but if he
was a confederate how did he happen to wear the blue,
too? Did he turn traitor to his cause?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Her manner was exasperating, and her words insulting,
and I knew by the fire in Fan’s eyes that she would spare
no detail in the story she meant to tell.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Traitor! Never!” she answered, hotly. “The blue
belonged to the Boy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And who was he? the Boy is so very indefinite,” Mrs.
Hathern asked in the same offensive tone, which made Fan
furious.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know who he was; not even his name. Let
me tell you how he came to us, blood-stained and worn
and frightened, and how we cared for him till he died, and
then you will know why this room is doubly sacred to us,”
Fan said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly, if you like; it must be interesting; but
please be brief as possible, as I am in a hurry,” was Mrs.
Hathern’s provoking remark, and seating herself upon the
bed, she prepared to listen, with a bored expression upon
her face.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan’s blood was up, and the sight of the woman whom
she believed to be Aunt Martha sitting so serene and unconcerned
on the bed, where thoughts of her had terrorized
the dying boy, roused her beyond quiet endurance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. Hathern,” she said, “please do not sit there.
It hurts me as much as if you were sitting on the Boy’s
grave.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Hathern smiled derisively. “I am very comfortable
and not at all superstitious. So I think I’ll stay, as
I am rather tired. I shall not hurt your Boy,” she said,
putting the pillow under her head and leaning back
against the headboard.</p>

<p class='c014'>I wish I could paint a picture of Fan’s white face and
dark gleaming eyes, as in words more eloquent than I can
write she told the story of the Boy, beginning at Fredericksburg
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>and coming down to the day when he came to Phyllis’s
cabin, bedraggled and worn, with a hunted look in his eyes
and pathetic entreaty in his voice as he begged us sometimes
not to let the soldiers get him, and again not to let his
Aunt Martha know where he was, as he could not go back
to her. Fan had taken the boy’s letter from the blue coat
pocket where it was kept and had read it, while Mrs.
Hathern’s face softened as I did not suppose it could
soften, and there was something like moisture in her eyes.
But she kept her place upon the bed until Fan told of the
few hints the boy had given of his antecedents.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In his delirium,” she said, “he talked of Carlyle,
who, I think, was his cousin,—of a dog whose name was
Don,—and of an Aunt Martha, who could not have been
kind to him, he seemed so afraid of her and so anxious
that she should not know where he was. If you could
have seen his poor wasted face and sunken eyes upon
the pillow on which you are lying, you would know why
this room is like a grave and why we cannot let a stranger
occupy it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At the mention of the wasted face and sunken eyes
which had lain upon the pillow Mrs. Hathern started as
if she had been stung, or had felt the cold touch of the
dead face Fan described so vividly. Crossing the room
she put one hand caressingly upon the blue coat, and
wiping the tears from her eyes with the other she said,
“I thank you for your kindness to the northern boy, and
shall not forget it. Did you never learn his name?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never,” Fan replied. “We asked him what it was,
and he said he was one of the Apostles. That is all we
know for sure. We advertised and wrote to the town in
Maine which he mentioned in his delirium, but nothing
definite could be learned except that a strange boy calling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>himself Joseph Wilde had enlisted in that place early
in the war and had not been heard of since. Charlie
called him <em>the Boy</em>. We have called him <em>the Boy</em> ever since,
and it is so engraved upon his tombstone. After he died
Phyllis and I cut two or three curls from his head for his
friends, if we ever found them, and I put them in Charlie’s
letter. He had soft brown hair, with a reddish tinge
in some lights, and it had grown very long for a boy.
See——?” and she held up the rings of hair which twined
around and clung to her fingers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I see,” Mrs. Hathern said in a trembling voice,
and I fancied that she recoiled from the hair as if it had
been a living thing confronting her with reproaches.
“I understand now your feelings with regard to this room
and respect them. It shall not be disturbed. I can find
another for Julina,” she continued; “and now, if you will
excuse me, I will go. I think I hear your father.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was herself again, cold, dignified and stiff, but gave
no sign that she was the Aunt Martha we had been
anxious to find. We were sure of it, however, and if anything
had been wanting to confirm us in our suspicions
we had it the next morning, which was Sunday. As was
our custom on that day we went after breakfast with
flowers to the cemetery, and found a small bouquet on
Charlie’s grave, and on the boy’s a larger one, while the
grass which was long had been trampled down by some
one kneeling or sitting upon it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aunt Martha has been here,” Fan said. “I really
think she has something human about her after all, but I
should like her better if she’d say square out ‘I am Aunt
Martha.’ I hate concealments.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On our return to the house we passed the cabin where Phyllis
sat on a wash-bench in the shade, shelling peas for dinner.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Mrs. Hathern done got ahead of you,” she said,
running her hands through the peas and letting them drop
back into the pan. “She was out before sun up, pickin’
de flowers, and went holdin’ her white petticoats mos’ up
to her knees cross de lot to de cemetry, whar she went
down face fo’most on de Boy’s grave, an’ when she coined
back her eyes was all red and watery. Like ’nuff she’s
some of his kin.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was scarcely possible that Phyllis suspected anything.
If she did, she kept it to herself. Neither did
Mrs. Hathern give any sign that she knew aught of the
boy, whom, to each other, we began to speak of as Paul,
while she was always Aunt Martha.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter XII.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>NORAH O’ROURKE AND JULINA.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>A suitable room had been found for Julina very near
Norah O’Rourke’s, and we were anxiously awaiting their
arrival, when one evening as we sat at the tea-table the
village ‘bus drove into the yard, loaded on the top with
baggage and filled inside, it seemed to me, with big hats
and feathers and ribbons. Nothing doubting that we were
about to be favored with some of Mrs. Hathern’s grand
Boston friends I was wondering if Phyllis would be equal
to the emergency and lamenting that Norah O’Rourke and
Julina were not at their posts, when Mrs. Hathern sprang
up, exclaiming, as she started from the room, “Norah
and Julina.” Father was not at home, and in his absence
Phyllis, who was waiting on the table, felt at liberty to
express herself with comparative freedom.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Oh, my Lord! I s’posed in course ’twas some quality.
Look-a-dar, will you?” she said, as she nodded her high
turban at the scene transpiring outside.</p>

<p class='c014'>Norah O’Rourke, gorgeous in purple traveling dress,
and big brown hat trimmed with green ribbons and feathers,
had alighted, and Mrs. Hathern, who had never
shown herself at all demonstrative, was kissing her, as she
told her how glad she was to see her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My Lord, my Lord, that I should live to see Mas’r
Hathern’s wife kiss a white nigger! What will de wah
fotch us next!” Phyllis exclaimed, and setting down the
teapot, from which she was filling my cup, she disappeared
in the direction of her cabin, out of sight of what she
considered a familiarity beneath the dignity of Mas’r
Hathern’s family.</p>

<p class='c014'>Full of curiosity Fan and I watched the group with
open-eyed wonder, deciding that Norah O’Rourke was
rather a formidable personage, of whom we might stand
in awe, and that Julina was airy and pert, but very graceful,
and dressed in much better taste than her companion.
Brought up as we had been among the negroes, we had
never seen a white servant in our lives and knew nothing
of the relation they held to their employers. That they
were more than slaves and less than equals we supposed,
but we were not prepared for the familiarity with which
Mrs. Hathern greeted Norah and Julina. She did not
kiss the latter, but she kept hold of her hand as she conducted
them into the house and up to their rooms, while
Norah, in her rich Irish brogue, declared Virginia the
most god-forsaken country she was ever in, and Richmond
the most tumble-down hole, and herself played out generally
with her long journey in cars which Boston wouldn’t
put cattle in.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>That night they took their supper in the dining-room
and Mrs. Hathern waited upon them, while Phyllis nursed
her wrath in her kitchen under the dogwood trees, where
later on I found a great many cooking utensils thrown
around promiscuously,—flatirons, gourds, tin dippers,
and brooms,—a sure sign of the tempest which had been
raging in the old negress’s breast. At that time my
sympathies were all with Phyllis, but in the light of later
experience I came to see how unreasonable she was in her
prejudice against both Norah and Julina, who were fair
representatives of their class and who could no more understand
the servility of a born slave like Phyllis than she
could understand their assumption of equality with those
they served. For some weeks I detested Norah for her
unmistakable air of <em>good-as-you</em>. Then I began to like her
so much that if she had gone away and returned to us I
think I might have kissed her without any hesitancy. She
had been recommended to Mrs. Hathern as honest and
trusty and neat and a good cook, with a temper of her
own and a strong disposition to rule the house, all of
which recommendations proved true. She was most
trusty and honest and a grand cook, with a temper as
recommended, and she did rule the house, and ruled it
so well and allowed so many privileges that Mrs. Hathern
submitted to the bondage, and by making everything
subservient to her wishes and raising her wages at intervals
she had managed to keep her so long that she had
become a part of herself and her ways, as Phyllis was a
part of ourselves and our ways. I never knew before
I met Norah O’Rourke that there could be so much
expressed in the creak of a shoe! Hers always creaked,—sometimes
more, sometimes less,—and after a little I
could tell by the sound exactly the mood she was in. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>her foot came down heavy and strong, even Mrs. Hathern
avoided her; if the tread was medium she ventured to
issue her orders; but when she had on her felt slippers,
as we designated her softest tread, she was like clay in our
hands, to be moulded at our will. We all stood a little in
fear of her, and father said, laughingly, that he did
not dare go into the kitchen without knocking for permission,
if her shoes were noisy. Between her and
Phyllis there was war from the first, and the two were
only restrained from open battles by being kept apart as
much as possible,—Phyllis on her premises under the dogwoods,
where she washed and ironed and bemoaned the
change which had come over her master’s family, and
Norah in her domain, where she concocted and served
the most wonderful dishes with the skill of a trained <em>chef</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Once Fan ventured to remonstrate with her for her
antagonism to Phyllis, whose many virtues she set forth in
glowing colors. Norah’s shoes creaked ominously as
she stamped around the kitchen, while her Irish dialect,
which she never used unless she was excited, came in full
play.</p>

<p class='c014'>“An’ sure,” she said, “you don’t know what ye’s
talkin’ about. When I’m riled, as I am a good part of the
time in this haythenish counthry, I’m spilin’ for a fight,
and if I didn’t pitch into that nagur, I should wallop you
all with my <em>shillalah</em> of a tongue.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After this we let matters take their course, trying occasionally
to smooth Phyllis down, when her plumage was
more than usually ruffled. If she was to be credited, she
<em>rassled</em> a good deal in <em>prar</em> for grace to do her duty and
<em>not</em> run away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Niggers and Irish wouldn’t mix more’n ile and water,”
she said, and of the two she detested July more than she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>did Rory O’Rock, the name she gave to Norah. “Such
a’rs,” she said, “axin me to call her Juleen ’case thar’s
a French <i><span lang="fr">axum</span></i> over her eye. What’s dat ar, I’d like to
know. I can’t see nothin’ over her eyes but dem great
shaggy brush heaps. Juleen, indeed! I shall call her <em>July</em>,
with her black eyes and bar and face, too. ’Spec she’s
some nigger blood in her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Julina’s father was plain Tom Smith, of Vermont, but
her mother was French, and from her the girl had inherited
many of the characteristics of the race. She was very
slight and would have been very pretty but for her large
teeth, over which her thin lips never quite closed. Dark-eyed,
dark-haired and dark-faced, with a certain airy
grace of speech and manner she looked the French maid
fully, especially in the little caps which she wore so jauntily,
but wore unwillingly. They were badges of servitude,
she said, and nothing would induce her to wear them if
Mrs. Hathern did not pay her extra for it. At heart she
was a born anarchist, and although she performed her
duties as housemaid thoroughly she hated them, and let
Fan and me know that she did, talking sometimes in
English and sometimes in French, which she had learned
from her mother, and hurled with great volubility at both
Norah and Phyllis when engaged in a spirited encounter.</p>

<p class='c014'>She made no secret to us of her dislike of Mrs. Hathern,
but she adored Carl, and her eyes lighted up with a
strange brilliancy when she spoke of him. He was expected
very soon and no one seemed more anxious for his
coming than Julina, although she took good care not to
express herself in the presence of his mother. Before
her she was always respectful and modest and quiet, but
to us she showed herself as she really was, and talked
freely of what she meant to be,—“not a drudge to go and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>come at another’s bidding, but a lady, to be served as
we were served.” She had it in her, if her father was
a poor farmer in Vermont. She had a good common-school
education. She had tact and common sense. Her
mother’s family were somebody in France, where she
meant to go when she had sufficient money, and then
we’d see what she could do.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter XIII.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>CARL.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding what he had said of his anxiety to
reach the Elms, he did not seem to be in a great hurry to
do so. He stopped some days in New York, and again in
Washington, and it was two weeks from the time he left
Boston before a telegram came to his mother saying he
was in Richmond and would be with us the next evening.
That same day Fan had a letter from Jack, who wrote:
“I was the first to make the acquaintance of Mrs. Hathern,
and am also the first to know her son Carl. He has
been at the Spotswood four days, and I verily believe
knows more of the city than I do. He has been everywhere
and seen everything, from Libby Prison, Castle
Thunder and Belle Isle to the fortifications in the country
for miles around. He has the most expensive room in
the hotel, and drives out with a span and a guide and
coachman, and myself, whenever I can find time to go out
with him. He has visited the State House and every store
and shop and office in town, and talked politics and reconstruction
with as much assurance as if he were a gray-haired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>veteran of fifty instead of a boy of fifteen or sixteen.
Everybody knows him and everybody likes him,
especially at the hotel, where he spends his money so
freely. I usually go there every night and look over the
register to see the new arrivals, and when I saw ‘Carlyle
Haverleigh, Boston, Mass.,’ I soon had him by the hand,
telling him who I was and asking what I could do for him.
<em>Do for him!</em> Bless your soul, he does not need anyone to
do for him; he is equal to anything; takes care of and
patronizes me; owns the whole south generally, and Richmond
and the Spotswood in particular. And yet he is
not in the least offensive in his patronage. It is just his
pleasant, genial, helpful way, which goes to your heart
directly. We call him <em>Boston</em>, and laugh at his ‘I guesses’
and ‘carnts’ and ‘sharnts,’ and tell him he ought to be
kept under a glass cover, with his fine clothes and white
hands. But he takes it in perfect good humor and ridicules
our ‘I reckons’ and ‘heaps’ and ‘right smarts,’ and
says we wear baggy, ill-made clothes, and talk through
our noses worse than any down-east Yankee he ever met,
but admits that we are a pretty good sort, on the whole,
for rebs, and much better, he presumes, for having been
<em>licked</em>! Think of it! A Boston cub, right from the very
heart of abolitionism and everything else, talking like
that to old Virginia soldiers, who shake their sides over
him. Truly the world moves, and we move with it, and
I am glad we do. I like the boy, or, perhaps, I should say
young man, for he is nearly as tall as I am, and straight
as an Indian, with a proud bearing as if the world were
made for him. He has a frank, ingenuous face, with clear-cut
features, laughing eyes, and a mouth which, if it were
a girl’s, would not be bad to kiss! I rather think it is a kissing
mouth, he is so fond of the girls,—talks to everyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>he meets in the hotel, and actually asked Mrs. Gen. Sands’
daughter Mabel, from South Carolina, to take a walk with
him. She took it and a blowing up, too, from her mother,
when she got home, while he took a worse one for his
presumption,—I’m not sure she didn’t call it impudence,—in
proposing such a thing to a southern girl and a
stranger. You should have seen Carl then. I was really
proud of him, he stood up so manly and dignified in the
parlor half full of people and said, ‘I beg your pardon,
madam; I meant no harm, I assure you. It was because
she was a southern girl that I asked her. I wanted to see
if she were like Boston girls; she is very much like them,
except, perhaps, more charming, because not quite so stiff.
I really did not intend to be impudent. I couldn’t, you
know. Why, I’m a <em>Bostonian</em>, a <em>Haverleigh</em>, and a <em>gentleman</em>!’</p>

<p class='c014'>“We all wanted to cheer, and Mrs. Sands most of all.
She has been out driving with him since and taken Mabel
with her. What strikes me as very remarkable about the
boy is his freedom from all bad habits. I don’t believe he
has one, unless it is a disposition to spend his money too
freely. He says he owes everything to his mother.
There was some bad blood in the family away back somewhere,
and she was as afraid of it as of a mad dog and
watched him as a rat would watch a mouse. When he
was ten years old some college chaps got him to drink and
smoke until he was so deathly sick that they feared he
would die. When he got over it his mother thrashed him
so soundly with a rawhide that he declares he has a mark
of one of the welts on his back yet. Then she told him
that for every year until he was twenty-one in which he
neither drank, nor smoked, nor chewed, nor swore, nor lied,
she would give him one hundred dollars over and above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the allowance she usually made him. She wanted to tack
on dancing and theatres, he said, but he kicked at that
and promised the rest, and kept his promise, too, until
last year, when he called a girl who lived with them a
d—— fool because she would make eyes at him. Quite
to his surprise his mother gave him fifty dollars, saying it
was only half a swear and the girl deserved it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“His father left a large fortune, the use of which is to
be his mother’s during her lifetime, with the exception
of twenty-five thousand dollars which are to be paid to
Carl when he is twenty-one. At his mother’s death he
gets the whole. So, you see, he will some day be a very
rich man and a great catch. Pity he wasn’t older, or
you and Annie younger. He has asked me a great many
questions about you; says he always wanted some sisters,
and knows he shall like you,—love, I think he said, but
he is only a boy and I am not jealous. He leaves day
after to-morrow and I shall miss him, for I find myself
looking forward to the close of business hours when I am
free to join him and hear his funny and original remarks
about us and our ways which he says are a hundred years
behind Boston.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This letter did not in the least diminish our desire to
see Carl Haverleigh, in whose coming the whole household
was interested. We were running like clockwork
now, with Phyllis as laundress, Norah as cook, Julina as
housemaid, and Boston baked beans and brown bread on
Sunday. We dressed for dinner and dined in courses at
six, while father wore his swallow-tail and Julina waited
upon us in her pretty white apron and cap. Mrs. Hathern’s
carriage and horses had come from Boston. We
had a colored coachman from Richmond, who wore a tall
hat and brass buttons and went to sleep on the box while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>driving us around the neighborhood. Altogether, we
were very high-toned and Bostony, and but for a few drawbacks
might have enjoyed the new order of things immensely.
Our house was handsomely furnished; father’s
debts were paid, and had he chosen he might have dismissed
his patients and lived a life of perfect ease. Mrs.
Hathern was very free with her money, and more generous
to Fan and me than we expected or deserved. But
there was always a feeling of restraint in her presence and
a hankering for the flesh-pots of Egypt, when it didn’t
matter whether things were in order or not, or we on time
to a minute; and then there was unfortunate Katy, who
not only spent hours in the high chair and in bed for
trivial things we had never dreamed of calling faults, but
to whose other trials was added that of daily music lessons.
Mrs. Hathern’s piano, a splendid Steinway, had come,
and the old one which had been our mother’s was moved
to make room for it. Then, following Miss Errington’s
advice, she commenced teaching Katy, who was required
to practice every day until her little arms and hands ached
with fatigue. She hated the practice, but liked the singing,
and every morning for half an hour or more the house
was filled with melody as she went up and down the scales,
clear and sweet as a bird, while I listened with pride and
Fan with fear of what might be the result in the future.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was to be a cessation of the lessons for a few
days on account of Carl’s arrival and because of a grand
picnic which was to be held in the woods near a little
waterfall and a fine bit of scenery. Everybody in town
who was anybody was going, and Mrs. Hathern was
especially glad that it was fixed for the day after Carl’s
expected arrival, as it would give her an early opportunity
to show her handsome and accomplished son to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>friends and neighbors. I think the New Englander revels
in picnics. Mrs. Hathern was certainly in her element
preparing for this one and for Carl, who was coming at last.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a lovely July day,—cool for the season, but with
that deliciousness in the air and deep blue in the sky common
to Virginia summers. Carl’s room was in readiness
for him. Julina had swept and dusted and lingered over
it longer than was at all necessary, and there was a light
in the girl’s eyes and an airiness in her movements which
irritated and disgusted us. Mrs. Hathern had hung upon
the walls a few pictures we had not seen before, some of
them exquisitely colored photographs of Venice and others,
copies of Pompeiian dancing girls, who, it seemed to me,
might have worn thicker garments and not have been
uncomfortable even in the summer. But I was not up in
high art and had not spent a year and a half abroad, like
Mrs. Hathern, who could contemplate and discuss a
Venus de Medicis or Apollo Belvidere as readily as a block
of unhewn marble. There was a head of a Madonna,
which Mrs. Hathern had found in Florence, in Carl’s
room, and Norah hung around its neck a string of beads
from Lourdes which had been blessed by the Pope; “not
for keeps,” she said, “but just for a little while to show
him I am glad he is coming.” Phyllis, too, had brought
the only valuable article she possessed,—a handsome
bowl of Royal Worcester, which a Federal soldier had
given her in exchange for a peck of apples and some walnuts.
It was stolen, of course, from some desecrated
home, but as Phyllis didn’t know where that home was
she had no compunctions in taking it, and since the war
it had stood on a little table at the head of the bed with
her pipes and tobacco and child’s first reader which she
kept there, not because she could read,—we had tried to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>teach her and failed,—but because it looked as if she
could. She had heard us talk so much of Carl that she
was interested, too, and brought the bowl full of flowers
and set it down by his photograph on the bureau.</p>

<p class='c014'>The morning was long and the evening was longer, but
five o’clock came at last and the carriage with Mrs. Hathern
and father and Katy went to the station, while Fan
and I waited at home upon the piazza, and Julina went
once or twice to the gate and looked anxiously down the
street. Suddenly there was the sound of rapid footsteps
and of some one whistling Dixie at the rear of the hall, and
in a moment Carl stood before us, flushed and expectant
and eager. The train, which was usually late, had been
ahead of time and pulled up at the station before the carriage
reached it, for something had happened to the harness
and detained it. Everybody knew Carl was coming,
and everyone at the station knew it was he as he leaped
upon the platform in his long linen duster and straw hat
and northern air generally.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Halloo! Is there anyone here from the Hatherns?
I am Carl Haverleigh,” was his salutation to the station
master, who replied that there was not yet, but undoubtedly
would be soon.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, is there a short cut to the house which I can
take and surprise them?” he asked next.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was one and Carl took it and brought up by
Phyllis’s cabin, where she sat quietly smoking under the
dogwood tree after her work was done. Jack had described
us all so minutely that Carl knew in a moment who
Phyllis was, and his cheery “Halloo, Aunt Phyllis. How
d’ye,” nearly threw the old woman off her seat. She did
drop her clay pipe, and Carl’s brown head and her red
turban knocked together as both stooped to pick it up.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“God bless you, Mas’r Carl! I’se jes tolable, thank
ye. How d’ye you ’self?” she said, taking her pipe from
him and holding his hand, white as a girl’s, in both her
black horny ones.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where are the folks?” he asked, and she replied,
“Ole Mas’r and Missus and Katy has done gone for you,
but you’ll find de young ladies in the piazza waitin’ for
you. We’s all right glad to see you, Mas’r Carl. Go
right up de path dar.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Following her directions he came next to the kitchen,
where Norah stopped her preparations for dinner to greet
him, while Julina darted out from some corner and seized
him by the hand, her black eyes full of the delight she
felt. But there was no answering gleam in his, and his
“How are you, Julina?” was cold and formal as he hurried
on to where we were sitting. Jack had written “He
is nearly as tall as I am,” but in his long duster he looked
taller, and there was such an air of fashion and maturity
about him that for a moment we felt abashed as if in the
presence of a full-grown young man of a different type
from any we had known. This feeling, however, soon
passed, for no one could withstand the cordiality of his
manner, or the expression of his frank, handsome face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Halloo,” he cried, “here you are, Fan-and-Ann, and
I am Carl.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He kissed us and whirled us round and told us he was
<em>first rate</em>, before we could say a word to him. Then, holding
each of us by the hand, he looked us over curiously
and critically.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You look just as I thought you did. The rest of the
folks have gone for me, I suppose,” he said, releasing our
hands, and beginning to remove his duster, “Won’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>mother scold though because I gave her the slip. Hallo,
there they are;” and he darted down the steps to meet
the carriage just entering the yard.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a slight cloud on Mrs. Hathern’s face as she
alighted and asked why he did not wait for them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I couldn’t. I was in such a hurry to see my sisters,
and here’s another one,” he said, lifting Katy in his
arms and squeezing her until she was red in the face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are a beauty, and no mistake!” he said, putting
her down and turning to father, towards whom his manner
was exceedingly polite and deferential.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was strange what a change his coming made in our
home. He was so bright and thoughtful and magnetic
that before the evening was over we felt that we had
known him years instead of hours. Jack was a gentleman,
and so were all our male acquaintances, while Col.
Errington represented the highest phase of polish we had
ever seen. But Carl was different from them all, with a
difference we felt but could not well define. He seemed
to know the right thing to say and when to say it and how
to bring out the best there was in one. I had never been
as well satisfied with myself as I was after that first evening
spent with him, his flatteries and compliments were so
delicate and seemed so earnest. Fan thought him not
altogether genuine and a little too familiar.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is too tall to be putting his arm around us so
much,” she said when we were discussing him in the privacy
of our room. “I call him a flirt, and if there was
nothing to keep us in mind, he’d forget us in a week,—but,
on the whole, I like him.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter XIV.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE PICNIC.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The picnic grounds were seven or eight miles distant,
and we were to start as early as possible so as to avoid the
heat of midday. Mrs. Hathern, whose ambition was to excel
in everything, had made great preparations for an elaborate
lunch, which was to be served by Phyllis and Julina.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan said she must have slept in her bonnet, as we found
her with it on when we went down to breakfast. Katy
was also ready, and so wild with excitement and anticipation
that she scarcely heard Mrs. Hathern’s oft repeated
warning not to soil her clothes unless she wished to stay
at home. She wanted to show Carl her kittens and puppies
and chickens, and finally took him down to feed the
ducks in a little artificial pond or basin by the side of the
lane, where they were assembled in full force, their quacks
growing louder and louder when they saw the little girl
approaching and knew by instinct that she was coming
to feed them. It was great fun throwing them crumbs of
bread and watching them as they swam after and fought
over them and then craned up their necks for more. For
a time everything went well and Katy’s white dress was
without spot or blemish, although her boots showed marks
of the soft soil around the basin. Then suddenly, neither
she nor Carl knew how, she slipped and fell in the worst
possible place. Her boots and stockings and dress were
covered with mud, spatters of which were on her sash and
face and hands, so that it was a most forlorn-looking child
who came to us, crying bitterly as she held up first one
foot and then the other and showed us her muddy hands.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“I am so sorry! Oh, what will mamma say? and can’t
I go?” was the burden of her cry as we began to wash off
the dirt and tried to comfort her.</p>

<p class='c014'>At that moment Mrs. Hathern, who had heard of Katy’s
mishap from Carl, appeared in the doorway, her face a
thunder cloud and her voice trembling with anger as she
said, “You naughty, disobedient child! Why did you go
to the duck pond at all? You know what I told you, and
I mean it, too. I shall send for Julina at once and put
you to bed where you will stay while we are gone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, mamma, mamma; please don’t make me stay at
home. I want to go so much. I didn’t think the bank
was so soft, and I wanted to show the big duck to Carl,”
was Katy’s despairing cry, as she stretched her little hands
imploringly toward her stepmother.</p>

<p class='c014'>But she might as well have pleaded with a rock.
Things generally had gone wrong in the household that
morning. Father had been called to an old patient who
lived miles away and was dangerously ill. Consequently,
he could not go with us unless we waited for him an
indefinite length of time. Phyllis had scorched one of the
finest table-cloths. Something ailed the range, and
Norah’s corn cakes were spoiled in the baking, thereby
putting her in a state where collision, or even conversation,
with her was not desirable. In looking about Carl’s room
to see if everything was in order, Mrs. Hathern had come
across a photograph which Julina had put behind some
books where Carl would be sure to find it if he ever took
up one to read. The girl’s admiration of her handsome
son was not unknown to Mrs. Hathern, who heretofore
had thought but little of it; but this was going too far, and
taking the picture to Julina she tore it into shreds, asking
what she meant by such presumption, and threatening her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>with instant dismissal if anything of the sort occurred
again. It was in vain that Julina protested that she only
wanted to put something in Carl’s room as all the rest had
done,—that she meant nothing wrong. Mrs. Hathern
heard her with scorn, and was so scathing and bitter that
Julina declared her intention of giving up her place and
going home at once. This Mrs. Hathern could not allow.
It was well enough for her to threaten dismissal, but for
Julina to forestall her by going voluntarily was another
thing. She was too well trained and too useful to be given
up lightly, and some concession had to be made before
matters were adjusted. Following this came the news
that Katy had fallen into the duck pond, and this was a
straw too much. She could conciliate Julina, because it
was for her interest to do so, but towards Katy she was
inexorable, notwithstanding that Fan and I pleaded that
for this once she might be forgiven.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Beat her, if you will, but let her go,” Fan said.
“Think what you are condemning her to,—a long day in
bed, while we are enjoying ourselves; and she has anticipated
it so much. Father would not allow it if he were
here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am very glad then that he is away, as I should be
sorry to have any serious disagreement with him on the
subject of family discipline,” Mrs. Hathern replied, in that
tone which always made us so angry.</p>

<p class='c014'>With a slight inclination of her head she left the room,
and the rattle of her stiff skirts as she swept down the
stairs reminded us of Norah’s shoes when she was in a
tantrum. In a few minutes Julina came in, sullen and
red-eyed, and began to remove Katy’s soiled clothes,
while the little girl cried bitterly with long-drawn, gasping
sobs, hard for us to bear and know that we were powerless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>to help her. What Julina thought we could not guess.
Her movements were rather jerky and spiteful as she undressed
the child and put her in the little cot, which stood
in one corner of our room. Katy’s tears, however, must
have moved her, for, as she drew the sheet up round her,
she said, “It’s awful mean, but I wouldn’t let her know
I cared. Norah will come and sit with you and bring you
some raspberry tarts.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she turned to leave the room, but stopped on the
threshold as if a new idea had suddenly occurred to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Katy,” she said, going back to the cot, “I believe
you’ll go yet. I am going to tell Carl.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She found him in the side piazza playing with the kittens,
and without softening the matter at all she acquainted
him with the facts.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where’s mother?” Carl asked, and there was a look
on his face like his mother as he started in quest of her.</p>

<p class='c014'>She had come up to his room where he found her and
as ours was directly opposite and the doors were open we
could not help hearing most of the conversation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother,” he began, in a voice I would never have
recognized as Carl’s, “what is this about Katy’s being
kept at home and sent to bed because of an accident?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose the young ladies have been complaining to
you,” Mrs. Hathern said, and Carl replied, “I have not
seen them since I came from the duck pond, but I know
about Katy, and it’s a burning shame to treat a little child
like that. I remember the hours,—yes, <em>weeks</em>, if all the
time were added up,—that Paul and I were kept in bed
or on chairs for trivial offenses. It’s worse than beating,
for that is soon over and done with; Paul said so the time
you thrashed him for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why do you bring up Paul so often?” Mrs. Hathern
asked, with what seemed a tremor in her voice.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“I don’t know, unless it is that he has been in my
mind all the morning, and I keep wondering if he were in
this part of the country,” Carl said, his voice softening as
he spoke of Paul, but hardening again as he continued,
“Don’t make Katy run away as Paul did. She was no
more to blame for falling into the mud than I was, nor as
much, and by George if she stays home I shall stay, too,
and go to bed; or, no, I’ll sit up and amuse her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here was a family jar in earnest, and we were thinking
of closing our door so as not to hear any more, when Mrs.
Hathern and Carl must have changed their positions or
spoken lower, as we distinguished nothing more, except
disjointed sentences, such as <em>for this once</em>, and <em>somebody’s
sake</em>—Carl’s, or Paul’s presumably. Then the former
crossed the hall quickly and knocked at our door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hop up, Katy!” he exclaimed, walking up to the cot
where Katy had raised herself on her elbow at the sound
of his voice. “You are going, if you’ll promise never to
fall into a frog pond again when you have on your best
clothes. Hurry! the carriage will be round in fifteen
minutes. Here are your shoes; but where the deuce are
your stockings?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy was on the floor by this time and we were all helping
her dress, Carl the coolest of the three and showing a
deftness and knowledge of straps and buttons and hooks
not common in a boy. She was ready in ten minutes, her
face a little flushed and stained with tears, but shining
with the light of a great and sudden joy, and as the last
pin was put in its place she threw her arms around Carl’s
neck and laying her cheek against his, said to him, “Oh,
Carl, I love you so much, and shall love you forever and
ever because you are so good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps you’d better say something handsome to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>mother for letting you go,” Carl said, adding hastily, as
he saw Katy’s look of perplexity and heard his mother
on the stairs: “Tell her she’s an angel, or a brick, or
an old darling, or something of that sort.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Usually Katy would have known what to say without
prompting, but in her excitement she seemed to have lost
her wits, and running up to Mrs. Hathern she exclaimed,
“I thank you so much, and you are an old darling, and
an old angel and an old brick; Carl said so, didn’t you,
Carl?”</p>

<p class='c014'>It would be difficult to describe the expression of Mrs.
Hathern’s face as she looked at her son, who, she knew
was responsible for this doubtful compliment, and who
laughed so long and loud that Fan and I laughed with
him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think you might refrain from teaching Katy slang,”
she said, with a smile she could not repress.</p>

<p class='c014'>With harmony thus restored we seated ourselves in the
carriage and were driven along the pleasant road and
through the shady woods to the picnic grounds, where
most of our friends were already assembled and where
Mrs. Hathern’s good humor soon came back to her with
the attention she received. No one’s lunch was as elaborate
as ours, or as daintily served, for both Phyllis and
Julina did their best. Julina’s face was clouded and scowling,
but she moved with a certain airiness and grace natural
to her, and spoke, when she did speak, in the language
of a lady rather than of a servant. Hitherto she
had only been seen by our neighbors when they called
and she let them in, but now she was prominent everywhere
and knew she was attracting attention, and her
black eyes shone and flashed, and her color came and
went until I began to think her positively pretty, and
said so to Fan, who was also watching her.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“Dangerous,” was her reply, while Carl, who was
standing near and heard her, added, “Has Satan in her
as big as a barn, and intrigue enough to overthrow an
empire. Thinks herself the equal of anybody and means
to prove it some day, and, by George, I believe she will.
I hope I shan’t be one of her victims.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This scarcely seemed possible, but there swept over me
suddenly a most unaccountable feeling that in some way
that dark, slim girl with the French blood in her veins
and the fierce ambition in her heart, might be a blot on
the life of the handsome boy, who was the lion of the picnic
as his mother was the queen. I had never seen her
as gracious as she was that day when she moved among
the people as if she had been the hostess instead of one
of them. I think it was Carl’s presence which made her
so different from the cold, precise woman we knew at
home. She was very proud of him and of the attention
he received. Everybody wished to know him and he
wanted to know everybody, and before the day was over
had said so many pleasant things and done so many little
courteous acts to both old and young that we were congratulated
on all sides for our good fortune in possessing
so delightful a step-brother. Carl was a success.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter XV.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>PAUL.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The next day was Sunday, and after our one o’clock dinner
Fan and I started for the cemetery on the hillside,
accompanied by Carl. We had omitted taking flowers
early in the morning, but we had them with us now, and
Carl carried them for us and asked many questions about
our brother as we went slowly across the fields.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shot at Fredericksburg,” he said. “That’s where a
cousin of mine was killed, if he were killed at all. We
tracked him to that battle, or thought we did, and have
never heard of him since.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Neither Fan nor I made any reply, and he went on:
“He was several years older than I, but too young to go
to the war. He lived with us and I loved him like a
brother, and when I really made up my mind that he was
dead I cried myself sick, and now I am sometimes so lonesome
for Paul that I want to cry just as I did then. It
is hard to believe he is dead, with no proof of it, and
every night I pray that he may come back to us, or that
we may know for sure what became of him. You pray,
don’t you? I heard Annie in church this morning, but not
a peep from you. I don’t believe you said the creed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was speaking to Fan, who answered rather shortly,
“I prayed so much for the success of the south during the
war, and we failed so utterly that I have about lost faith
in prayer, and have come to think that what is to be will
be, and we can’t help ourselves; so what is the use of
praying? Didn’t the north pray with all their might that
their army might be victors, and didn’t we do the same,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and wern’t we just as much in earnest as you were, and
which did the Lord hear?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Our side, of course, because we were right, and had
the most men and money. You shouldn’t have been a
Reb if you wanted the Lord to hear you. What could
you do against the Lord and such hordes as we had to
fight you with?” Carl said, while Fan tossed her head
high in the air, but did not continue the conversation.</p>

<p class='c014'>We were in the enclosure now under the pine trees and
were laying the flowers we had brought upon the four
graves, our mother’s, Katy’s mother’s, Charlie’s and The
Boy’s. Carl was reading the inscriptions on the tombstones,
first mother’s, then Katy’s mother’s, then Charlie’s,
over which he lingered. “Only nineteen; he would be
twenty-three now, that’s a little older than Paul, if he
were living. Halloo! what does this mean, ‘The Boy, who
died Good Friday, 1863.’ That’s a queer inscription.
Who was The Boy?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We don’t know,” Fan said, sitting down on an iron chair
near the grave and clasping her hands at the back of her head.</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl looked at her mystified and curious.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He was one of your people,” she continued, “and I
hated you all, until he came to us and died, with his hand
in mine, hurrahing for me. I haven’t hated anybody
since. Would you like to hear his story?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” Carl said, and leaning upon the stone he listened
while Fan told the story in all its details as only she
could tell it.</p>

<p class='c014'>At its close Carl was down upon the grassy mound,
crushing the flowers we had put there, and sobbing bitterly,
“Paul, Paul,—it was Paul! I have found him at last
dead, and I had hoped he might come back to me alive.
Oh, Paul, I am so sorry for everything.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>We were all crying now, and surely over no soldier’s
grave, north or south, east or west, was sadder moan ever
made than over that of The Boy that summer afternoon
years and years ago. Whatever of wrong there had been
in Carl’s treatment of Paul it was atoned for, if tears can
atone for a wrong done to the dead. I had never seen a
man or boy cry as Carl cried, with his face upon the grass.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t,” Fan said at last. “Don’t you remember that
he bade us tell you he liked you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I know, and it’s that which hurts, and the knowing
for sure that he is dead,” Carl answered, lifting up
his head and wiping away his tears. “I have dreamed
so often that he came back that I have almost made myself
believe that he would, and I have planned so many
things to do when he came. Strange, too, that he has
been so often in my mind since I came here. You told
me that your woods were often full of Federal troops, and
many times at the picnic I was saying to myself, ‘Was
Paul ever here? Did he see this waterfall, or sleep under
that big tree near which they said camp fires were built?’
and now I am by his grave, and you cared for him when
he died. Tell me more, if there is more to tell.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was not much, except to show the letter dictated
by Charlie and written by The Boy. This, with the lock
of hair and the knife and jews-harp Fan had purposely
brought with her, meaning to tell the story to Carl just as
she had told it. The writing was a scrawl, for the hand
which wrote it was throbbing with pain, but Carl identified
it as Paul’s by the capitals and the formation of some
of the letters. The hair and jews-harp and knife he
remembered perfectly, and cried again as he held them in
his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If I had been beaten in his place, as I ought to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>been he might not have run away, but I was a coward and
a sneak,” he said referring to a theft of cake which had
been charged to Paul and not denied because he wished
to shield his cousin.</p>

<p class='c014'>The memory of this seemed to hurt Carl the most, and
he went over the incident again and again, ending
always with the cry, “If I could only take it back.”
Then he told us briefly what there was to tell of Paul,
whose last name was also Haverleigh, as their fathers had
been brothers. Both Paul’s parents had died when he
was young, and he had been, in a way, adopted by his Aunt
Martha, who was very fond of him until the birth of Carl,
when there came a change.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose my being her own naturally made a difference,”
Carl said, “and I know now there was a difference,
although mother might not have intended any. I
was a spoiled child, and Paul was a lively, wide-awake
boy, who, with nothing bad about him, was constantly
getting me and himself into scrapes, which mother, with
her strict notions, thought awful. Sometimes we were
sent to bed or set on hard chairs until they must have
ached; I am sure we did. She never inflicted corporal
punishment upon Paul but once, and that was about the
cake which she thought he stole and lied about. So she
thrashed him, and he was nearly as old as I am now.
‘Too big to be licked,’ he said, and ran away. Where
he went at first I do not know, and shall never know now,
but after the war broke out we traced him, or thought
we did, to the army as a drummer boy. Then mother
went to Europe for two years, leaving me at school.
When she came home she did try to find him and was
almost sure he was at Fredericksburg, and that is all.
Does mother know?” he asked, and Fan replied, “I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>told her the story just as I told it to you. She could
draw her own conclusions.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment Carl was silent, and then he asked,
“Did she give no sign that she understood?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She cried and has put flowers on his grave every Sunday
since,” was Fan’s answer, and Carl continued: “Yes,
she knows, and she is sorry,—more sorry than you think.
Mother is a good woman, who means to do right, but, unfortunately,
her ideas run in a groove too narrow and deep
for her to get them out easily. She is Puritanical all
through,—great, great, great and double great something
of Miles Standish and the Mayflower. I don’t care a fig
for either, but I love my mother, and I want you to love
her, too. It will be better all round. She is quick to
reciprocate, and isn’t a bad sort by a long shot,—a little
stiff, that’s all; and if she didn’t own up about Paul, it was
a kind of pride which kept her silent. If you told the
Aunt Martha part with half the <em>vim</em> you told it to me, she
could have no doubt of your opinion of her, and it
required a good deal of pluck for her to say ‘I am that
woman.’ But she will do it. She’ll tell me Paul is here,
and she’ll tell you that she is Aunt Martha, and propose a
big monument for Paul and Charlie.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no,” Fan interposed. “We knew your cousin as
The Boy, and as such he must remain. We can have no
tall monument here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On our return to the house we found Mrs. Hathern sitting
on the piazza. Katy, to whom she had been teaching
her duty towards her neighbor, had fallen asleep with her
head on her stepmother’s lap, while Mrs. Hathern’s hand
was lying lightly on the child’s yellow curls. It was a
very pretty picture of domestic happiness, and I began to
think that, as Carl had said, his mother was not a bad sort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>after all. There was an anxious, worried look on her face
as we came up the steps, on which we all sat down, as the
day was very hot.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Carl,” she began, with a lump in her throat, “you
have been to Paul’s grave and have heard how kindly he
was cared for by Fanny and Annie?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl nodded, and she went on: “It was a shock to
me to know that he was here. You told your sisters, I
hope, how we tried to trace him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I told them everything,” Carl answered, and
she continued: “I am glad you did. I couldn’t tell them
when I first knew about it. I simply couldn’t, and I waited
for you to come. I would give a great deal to have
Paul back alive, but as that cannot be, I am glad to know
where he is lying; and if you think best we will have him
removed to our family lot in Mt. Auburn.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never, no, never,” and Fan sprang to her feet. “He
is <em>our Boy</em>. He died with us; we buried him; we loved
him. He was ours, and we must keep him here with
Charlie.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You shall, if you feel like that,” Mrs. Hathern said,
“and both Carl and I are more thankful than we can express
for the kindness he received from you all. I told
your father while you were at his grave, and it affected
him greatly. It is strange that our families should be
thus brought together, and I hope that the memory of
Paul may be a bond of sympathy and kindly feeling between
us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She held out her hand first to Fanny and then to me,
and as we took it we felt that there had already commenced
a better understanding between us than had existed
before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I told you she would face the music, and for her she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>did it handsomely,” Carl said, when we were alone with
him. “She knows she was to blame, and if I were you,
I wouldn’t <em>nag</em> her about him any more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This he said to Fan, who only answered with a flash of
her black eyes. But we understood what he meant, and
Paul was never mentioned by us in her presence unless she
spoke of him first, which she seldom did. A monument,
which should have both his and Charlie’s name upon it,
was suggested by her and vetoed by us all. He came to
us as the <em>Boy</em>; he died the <em>Boy</em>, and the <em>Boy</em> he must always
be to us, a sacred memory, which united the Hatherns
and Haverleighs more closely and proved a bond of
sympathy and friendship between us and our stepmother.</p>

<p class='c014'>Looking back through a vista of years and turning some
blotted pages of Carl’s life, when temptation got the better
of him, I cannot recall a pleasanter summer than that
which he spent with us at the Elms. He was so bright
and suggestive and thoughtful for every one, and so anxious
to please and make the best of everything that he
carried sunshine wherever he went. It was a rare gift he
possessed of winning all hearts to him, and Fan and I
learned more than one lesson of forbearance and toleration
from him, although we laughed at him as a prig
and should have called him a <em>dude</em>, had the word then
been invented.</p>

<p class='c014'>With the townspeople he was very popular, especially
with the young girls, who seemed suddenly to have grown
very fond of Fan and myself, and who came to our house
at all hours of the day. We had not supposed that Mrs.
Hathern cared much for young people, but she was very
gracious to Carl’s friends. She gave us teas on the
lawn and lunches on the piazza, and played for us to dance
in the drawing room and planned excursions for us so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>that the summer was one long holiday, with Carl as the
central figure.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was September when he left us for Andover, and
there were nearly as many people at the station to see him
off as there used to be when our soldiers left us for the
war. Naturally, after so much pleasant intercourse we
expected a great deal of pleasure from his letters. But
here we were disappointed. He wrote to us often at first,
telling us of his life at Andover, but evincing little interest
in the people of Lovering, who remembered him so
kindly and spoke of him so often. Then his letters grew
shorter and less frequent, and when Fan berated him for
it, he gave as an excuse that he was very busy with his
studies, trying to fit himself to enter Harvard the next
year.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But whether I write often, or not at all, you may be
sure that you are always in my mind and that I love you
dearly,” he wrote, and signed himself, “Your loving
brother, Carl.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nonsense,” Fan said. “It is a clear case of ‘out of
sight, out of mind.’ He was pleased with us when here,
but now we are like names written on the sands of the sea
which the first wave washes away. Carl is nice, but
fickle.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The autumn following Carl’s visit to us passed with little
to break the monotony of our lives. Miss Errington
wrote occasionally, full of solicitude with regard to Katy’s
music, which was progressing so rapidly as to astonish both
Fan and myself, and even Mrs. Hathern, who was a thorough
and exacting teacher. Jack wrote often and Fan
answered when she felt like it. She had not yet made up
her mind to be the wife of a poor man, and until she did
she could not encourage Jack in his foolishness. Col.
Errington did not write again and his proposal of marriage
remained unanswered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am very well as I am, and quite chummy with Mrs.
Hathern, who has really contributed a great deal to our
bodily comfort. I do not want a change as much as I
did, and as long as I have two strings to my bow and can
choose either at any moment, I am content,” she said, and
took the good the gods had provided and laughed over
Jack’s love-letters, which were becoming importunate and
impatient as he longed for something to work for and hope
for and keep his courage up.</p>

<p class='c014'>As for the household, it moved on with a regularity
which no one but Mrs. Hathern could have achieved.</p>

<p class='c014'>One or two jars there were when Phyllis’s turban was
frightfully awry and Norah’s shoes could be heard all over
the house; but, for the most part, they were on amicable
terms and both united in their antipathy to Julina, who was
growing more airy and important every day, and more disinclined
to believe in that portion of the catechism which
bade her to be content with the condition of life to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>it had pleased God to call her. “Who would ever get on
in the world if they followed that injunction?” she said,
and what was our democratic government good for if it
didn’t give everyone an equal chance to rise if he had
the brain and will to do so? And she meant to rise. She
had once had her fortune told by a clairvoyant in Boston
who predicted that she would some day be a great lady,
with money and influence at her command. This she
communicated confidentially to Fan and me as the secret
of her ambition and belief in the future. And at last
there came a rift in the clouds,—an opening through
which she caught a glimpse of the future she felt so sure
of. Her father died suddenly, and the letter which
brought the news enclosed one from an aunt in France inviting
Julina, who was her namesake, to visit her for as
long a time as she chose to stay. Here was her opportunity,
and she took it and left us at once, so full of her
aunt’s chateau, which, she said, was not far from Fontainebleau,
that she came near forgetting to mourn for her
father, who had never been much to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two or three weeks later Carl wrote that he had seen
her in Boston and that she was to sail for Havre in a few
days. Afterwards he sent us a list of passengers on a
French steamer, and among them was the name <em>Mademoiselle
Julina Smythe</em>, who for years passed completely
out of our knowledge and then reappeared in a most unexpected
manner.</p>

<p class='c014'>Christmas came and went, and the winter glided into
spring and spring into the first days of June, when the
world,—or, at least, that part which Lovering represented,—was
full of the beauty and brightness and fragrance of
early summer. Never before had our grounds and garden
been as lovely and attractive as they were now. Money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>and taste can do almost everything, and Mrs. Hathern had
both, and had expended them freely upon The Elms, which
she meant to make the show place in the county. It was
exceedingly pretty now, with its grassy lawn, its urns and
baskets of various designs and sizes, its rustic chairs and
stands for books or work or tea, and its garden full of
flowers. After all, it was not a bad thing that father did
when he married Mrs. Haverleigh, who had brought us so
much luxury and to whom we were getting quite reconciled.
She had been so much softer and more companionable
since Carl’s visit and our talk with her of The Boy
that I began to like her; while Fan, who was slow to
change her mind, admitted that things might be worse,
and if——. There is nearly always an “if” in every cup
of happiness, and ours was so unlooked-for and seemed so
undesirable that for a time we refused to accept it as dutiful
daughters ought to have done. But there was no
alternative; we could not run away, for there was no place
to run to, and after a while we made up our minds to submit
as gracefully as we could to the inevitable.</p>

<p class='c014'>In due time a trained nurse arrived from Boston, and a
few days later father went in and out of his bed-chamber
with an anxious look and frequent demands on Phyllis,
who, in her excitement, forgot to put on her turban and
seemed like one distraught as she hovered between the
kitchen and the sick-room; while Fan and I, with Katy
between us, sat under an elm in the farthest part of the
grounds and waited, wondering what Carl would say when
he heard the news. Norah brought us our lunch, which
we ate on the little willow table where we had often had
our tea. Her face was cloudy and her shoes creaked even
on the grass, showing us her opinion of the matter. I
remember so well every incident of that long day,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>glints of sunshine through the trees, the scent of the
flowers, the blue of the sky, the twitter and almost human
talk of two robins teaching their young ones to fly,
and, at last, as the evening wore on and we heard the town
clock strike two, Phyllis coming to us across the lawn,
her face all aglow with the news she had to tell.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’ve done got a little brudder,” she said, “an’ oh!
my Lord, he’s dat small. I reckon he could wear one of
Miss Katy’s doll dresses. Will you come to the house
and I’ll fotch him to you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, thank you,” Fan said, with a disdainful toss of
her head. “I am in no hurry to see my little brother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>What Fan did, I generally did, and against my better
judgment I, too, sat still, but asked, “How is Mrs. Hathern?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mighty bad, I s’pecs, by the way old Mas’r looks and
that Boston nuss. She hasn’t seen her baby at all an’
she’s as white as a piece of paper, and keeps moanin’
like.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you think she will die?” Fan asked, with a ring
in her voice which reminded me of the days when we were
watching by The Boy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, de good Lord forbid!” was Phyllis’s ejaculation.
“What could we do with a new bawn baby and the mother
dead?”</p>

<p class='c014'>What, indeed, and why was he sent to us, we asked
ourselves, as we sat watching Phyllis going swiftly across
the lawn with Katy in advance. Katy was happy, and
her first exclamation as she sped away from us was, “Oh,
I am so glad, and can I see him now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I don’t know how long Fan and I sat discussing the
situation, she threatening to answer Col. Errington’s letter
and I proposing to make the best of what could not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>helped. Perhaps it was an hour, perhaps it was more,
when Phyllis appeared again, holding her apron to her
eyes with one hand and beckoning us wildly with the
other.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. Hathern is done took wus, and has as’t for
you,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>In an instant we were on our feet, flying towards the
house, Fan, as usual, outstripping me and thinking with
remorse of the bitter things she had said of the innocent
baby, whose plaintive wail we heard as we entered the
hall. In every woman’s heart, be she ever so bad and hard,
there is a motherly instinct which, under certain conditions,
will assert itself. We were neither very hard nor
very bad. We were only rebelling as grown-up daughters
sometimes do against the introduction in their midst
of a baby, and especially when that baby is the offspring
of a stepmother. We had not wanted the stepmother,
and we didn’t want the baby; but when its faint cry came
to us Fan clutched my arm and whispered, “Oh, Ann,
hear the poor little thing. I hope its mother won’t die.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It seemed to me very probable that she would, when I
entered her room and saw her lying there so motionless
upon her pillows, with every particle of her bright color
gone from her face, which looked pinched and haggard
and old for a woman of only forty. She had never seemed
more than thirty-five. Her eyes were closed and we
might have thought her asleep, but for a fluttering of the
lids and a movement of her hand as the rustle of our
dresses broke the stillness of the room. Katy, who had
been fondling the baby, which a negro woman was caring
for in an adjoining room, had joined us, and when she
saw the white face so changed from what it had been the
previous night, when it looked the picture of health, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>ran up to father, who was sitting at the side of the bed,
and cried out, “Oh, papa, what is it? What makes her
look so? Is she very sick?”</p>

<p class='c014'>A warning sh—— came from the nurse, who was moistening
the patient’s lips with some stimulant; but at the
sound of Katy’s voice, Mrs. Hathern moved slightly and
opened the great black eyes of which we had stood so
much in awe. There was nothing to fear from them now,
and it seemed to me there was in them a look of wonderful
tenderness and love as they rested upon the little girl
who was bending close to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Katy,” she said, putting her hand upon the curly
head which nestled down beside her as Katy asked again,
“Are you very sick, mamma, and do you know about the
baby? We’ve got one in the other room. Old Chloe
brought him this morning, with a heap of clothes. I’m
so glad.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A faint smile showed around Mrs. Hathern’s mouth
and her hand pressed more heavily upon the golden curls.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, Katy,” she said, very low as if talking were an
effort, “I know about the baby, and I want you to love
him and care for him if I should go away. Will you,
Katy?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Just so, ten years before, Katy’s mother, in that very
room, had spoken to Fan and me, and the scene came back
to us so vividly,—the young mother dying and commending
to us the little life which had just begun and had since
grown to be a part of our whole being. Now it was another
mother, and Katy to whom the charge was given,
and for a moment I think we both felt chagrined that
we should be forgotten; but only for a moment. Turning
her eyes towards us, they shone with a strange light
of satisfaction as she said, in detached sentences, “Fanny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and Annie, I am glad you have come. I want to tell you
it was my way that was in fault, not my heart, and I
am sorry for all that has gone wrong. You like Carl; try
and like my little baby. I know he is not welcome, and
when I am gone he may be still less so; he is not to blame.
Perhaps God will take him with me; if not, be kind to
him, for his father’s sake, and—” She stopped a few
moments as if tired out and then resumed, as her eyes
wandered around the room, “Where is Fanny?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here I am,” Fan answered, sitting down upon the
edge of the bed and taking in hers the cold, clammy hand
which was moving restlessly. “Here I am; do you want
to tell me something?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes. About the little baby. Would you object to
calling him <em>Paul Haverleigh</em>, after The Boy?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no; I’d like it,” Fan answered with a choking
voice, for, with that subtle intuition which we cannot
define, she felt the dark shadow stealing into the room
and settling upon the features of our stepmother.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In my wish to do right, I went wrong with Paul. I
know it now, and am sorry. I shall tell him when I see
him, and tell him of you. Keep Carl straight. He has
fine instincts, but is easily influenced and may be led
astray if the temptation comes in pleasant guise. If he
falls it will be a woman who lures him on. Keep him
as much as possible under your influence and Annie’s.
I wish I might see him again, but—” Here her mind began
to wander. “It’s getting late. Katy ought to go to
bed. Good-night, Katy. I have loved you more than
you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She lifted herself up and kissed the bright face bent
down to hers, and then lay back upon her pillow as if utterly
exhausted.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“Must I go to bed before the sun is down?” Katy
whispered to her father, who shook his head and held her
closely to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was hours yet before the sun would set, and as they
dragged slowly on we watched the dying woman who
talked of many things strange to us. Of her first husband
and her early home in Maine, and the school-house under
the hill with the girls and boys she had known and played
with there. They were old men and women now, she
said, and their faces were tired and worn as if life had been
hard to bear, and she had so much wanted to help them
in some way. Then she spoke of Paul and we learned
more of him from her ravings than we had known before,
and saw more of the motives and principles which
had actuated her conduct. Neither were bad, but strict
almost to severity. Then she talked of Carl and Katy
and father and ourselves, who, she said, did not understand
her, but she never mentioned the little baby so
soon to be left motherless. He had come into her life so
recently and his coming had brought her so low that she
seemed to have forgotten him entirely. She grew very
quiet at last and fell asleep, while Fan, who always rose
to the occasion, took her post at the bedside, bidding the
nurse take the rest she needed so much. It was not a
long vigil we kept, for as the sun was setting Mrs. Hathern
awoke and began to move her hands over the bedclothes
as if in quest of something.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where is it? Do you know?” she said to Fan, who,
divining her meaning, went to the next room where the
baby was sleeping in Phyllis’s lap.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan had not seen it yet and she scarcely glanced at it
now, but she lifted it very carefully in her arms and
brought it to its mother.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“Look,” she said. “It’s the baby.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Very curiously the sick woman looked first at Fan and
then at the child, but the mist of death had gathered too
thickly on her brain for her to realize the truth. The
baby was a puzzle she could not solve.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Whose is it? Yours?” she asked, putting her hand
upon its head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” Fan answered very gently. “It is your baby,—little
Paul. Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a struggle between reason and delirium, but
the soul was drifting away too far for any real consciousness
or memory. Only the name of Paul arrested and
held it for a moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Little Paul,” she whispered, with a smile. “Yes,
he was a pretty boy when I took him; bigger than this
one. Whose did you say it is? And who are you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her hand still lay on the baby’s head, but her eyes
were closed. She was going fast and Fan knew it, and in
an ecstasy of grief and terror held the baby face close to
the white lips and said, “<em>Mother</em>, <em>mother</em>, it is your baby.
Kiss him once, that I may tell him. It is little Paul.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She had never before called Mrs. Hathern <em>mother</em>, and
now it came from her involuntarily, born of her pity for
the dying woman and helpless child. But it produced a
wonderful effect. Quickly the eyes unclosed and were
illumined with a strange light as they beamed upon
Fan.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You called me <em>mother</em>,” she said, “and it brings
things back to me and makes me glad. Thank you,
Fanny. Hold the baby nearer while I kiss him for the
first and last time. Little Paul, my little Paul.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She put her arms around the boy, kissed him twice and
never spoke again, although she lived until the early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>dawn of the next day, and then died as peacefully as if
going to sleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was I who went with father on the long, sad journey
to Mt. Auburn, where the costly monuments and signs
of grandeur everywhere were in striking contrast to the
simple cemetery on the hillside where she had expressed
a wish not to be buried; but when the ceremony of
interment was over and we turned away, leaving our dead
there alone, I felt that when my time should come I
should far rather lie down under the whispering pines,
within sight of the lights of home, than be left in that
“beautiful city of the dead.” The family monument was
tall and grand, and beside the husband’s name was that
of “Paul Haverleigh, who died in Lovering, Va., March,
1863, aged 18 years.” I did not know before that it was
there, and when I saw it I was conscious of an added feeling
of respect and regret for the woman whose real worth
I had, perhaps, not fully appreciated.</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl had met us in Albany, so stunned by the shock of
his mother’s death that he scarcely spoke at all, and never
asked a question until after the burial and I was alone
with him at the Revere, where we stopped, as his mother’s
house was rented. I do not think he had shed a tear,
but his face was very pale and there were dark circles
under his eyes as he sat down by me and said: “Now,
Annie, tell me about it. Why did mother die? What was
the matter?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at him in some surprise and asked, “Do you
really know nothing?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing,” he answered, “except the telegram saying
she was dead. I supposed her perfectly well. She wrote
to me last week as usual. It must have been terribly
sudden.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“It was sudden,” I said. “It was almost like well to-day
and dead to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what was it?” he asked, a little impatiently, and
I replied, “Carl, don’t you know there is a little baby at
The Elms, your brother and mine, who cost your mother
her life?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A baby? Your brother and mine? It is not true,”
he exclaimed, springing to his feet and staring at me as
if in some way I were to blame.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is true,” I said. “There is a baby at The Elms,
born a few hours before your mother died, and Fan is
caring for it. That’s why she didn’t come. She held it
for your mother to kiss before she died. ‘My little Paul,’
she called it, and those were the last words she ever
spoke. ‘My little Paul.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>Whether it was the memory of the Paul whose grave
was under the Virginia pines, or the thought of his dying
mother kissing her little boy, or both, I cannot tell; but
something unlocked the flood-gates of Carl’s tears, and
laying his head on my shoulder he sobbed bitterly, while
I tried to comfort him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t, Annie,” he said, “don’t speak to me; don’t
try to stop me. I must cry. I am so glad to cry. I
couldn’t at first for the something that choked me so,
when I heard mother was dead.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He grew calm at last, and began to talk naturally, inquiring
after Fan and Katy, and Norah and Phyllis, but
saying nothing of the baby. Nor during the few days
we stayed in Boston did he ever speak of it of his own
accord. He evinced, however, a good deal of interest in,
as well as knowledge of, business matters, which were
necessarily discussed by my father. By the conditions of
the Haverleigh will Carl was now sole heir of his father’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>fortune, which was larger than we had supposed. Knowing
that he had inherited her love for luxury and expenditure,
his mother had purposely kept from him the exact
amount of his father’s estate, which, now that he knew it,
filled his mind more than the very small amount which
little Paul was to have by will from his mother. From
the income of her husband’s money Mrs. Hathern had
only saved a few thousands, which were hers to do with
as she pleased, and these, by a will made a few weeks
before her death, she had left equally to my father and their
child, should he live; so, while Carl counted his money by
hundreds of thousands, little Paul had scarcely three. My
father had the same and all the furniture which had been
taken to The Elms. I do not think the discrepancy
between his fortune and that of his brother occurred to Carl.</p>

<p class='c014'>The baby was something wholly unexpected and whose
existence he could not realize. The money was <em>his</em> father’s,
not little Paul’s, and he accepted it as a matter of
course, assuming, as it seemed to me, a slight air of importance
as the heir to so much wealth. He was very kind
to us, and very generous during our stay in Boston, paying
all our bills and insisting upon taking us everywhere,
or, rather, taking me. Father had no heart to go, but I
was young, and the sights of Boston were new and wonderful,
and I went wherever Carl took me. Sometimes he
spoke of his mother and always with great affection, but
he never mentioned Paul until the day we left when he
brought me a silver rattle, which he said was for “the
little shaver,” who, he presumed, would be a lot of bother
to us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Indeed, he will not,” I answered, rather hotly, for I
was irritated by his indifference. “He is a dear little
thing, and so you will think when you come to us in July.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“I don’t believe I shall come,” he said, hesitatingly,
and without looking directly at me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not come!” I repeated. “Oh, Carl, we have anticipated
your visit so much that you must not disappoint us.
Your mother wanted us to see a great deal of you, and
Fan and I will do all we can to make you happy. You
said you liked Virginia and us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“So I do,” he answered. “I like you immensely, but
you see mother’s not being there will make it so sad, and
then a lot of the boys are going to camp out in the Adirondacks
and want me to go with them. It will not take
all summer, though, and, perhaps, I’ll run down for a week
or two at the last; so don’t look so gloomy, sister mine.
I do love you and Fan and Katy dearly, and I did have a
grand time at The Elms; but you see mother is gone, and
I like change and new faces,—a new one for every day of
the year, if I could have it. Bad in me, I know; but I was
born that way, and can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He didn’t seem quite like the Carl of the previous year.
He was older,—more mature, more like a young man of
twenty-one than a boy of seventeen. But he kissed me
very affectionately at parting, and sent his love, with a
shell comb, to Fanny, a doll for Katy, a red silk handkerchief
for a turban for Phyllis, and a new gown to Norah.</p>

<p class='c014'>These, with the silver rattle, I brought to our home,
which seemed very desolate without the ruling spirit
which had kept us at so high pressure that, although we
had not at first liked it, we missed it, now it was gone,
more than we had thought possible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I really don’t know when to go to bed, or get up, or
what I ought to do when I am up,” Fan said, with a half
sob as we talked matters over the night after my return.</p>

<p class='c014'>She had dismissed the nurse as too expensive an article
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to keep. She knew that the money which had been spent
so lavishly for us all must cease with Mrs. Hathern’s
death, and when I told her what had been left to father,
she said, “For his sake I wish it might have been more;
he is growing old and his practice is nothing. For ourselves
I don’t care. We learned a good many useful
lessons from Mrs. Hathern, and I hope we shall not fall
back into our old slipshod ways. We have certainly
gained something by her coming here,—orderly habits,
and <em>our baby</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a world of tenderness in her voice as she
said “our baby” and bent over the cradle where he was
sleeping. He was so small that I was half afraid to touch
him lest he should break in my hands like some brittle
toy; but Fan took to him naturally, constituting herself
his nurse and exulting over every sign of growing intellect
or physical strength as if she had been his mother.
What Carl would think of him was a question we often
asked ourselves as we counted the weeks he was to spend
in the Adirondacks, and then began to look for his coming.
But we looked in vain. Following the Adirondacks
was an excursion to the White Mountains, which lasted
so long that at its close only a few days remained in which
to visit us before returning to Andover, and he hardly
thought it would pay to take the long journey for so short
a time. He wrote to us often long chatty letters full of
affection and promises to spend the whole of the next
long vacation with us. But the long vacation came and
went and was succeeded by another and another, and still
Carl did not come.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>AFTER FIVE YEARS.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>It is a question whether one can truly love more than
once. I do not think a woman can. But men are different
and seem capable of many loves. If anyone doubts
this let him recall the number of widows and widowers
among his acquaintance, and see if there are not fifty per
cent. more of the former than of the latter. Three
women had called my father husband and I believe he had
loved them all devotedly, but whether it was the suddenness
of the blow, or because he missed the force and
energy which had kept him going, the death of the last
Mrs. Hathern crushed him completely, and made him an
old man at once.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know what ails me, girls, but since your
mother died I don’t seem to have any life or ambition
left. I am like a clock which has run down and can’t be
wound up again,” he would say to us when he came in
from a walk into town or country where he still had a few
patients of the old school.</p>

<p class='c014'>He had never spoken to us of Mrs. Hathern as our
mother while she lived; but now that she was dead he
always mentioned her in that way, and we humored him,
and sometimes called her so ourselves, and petted and
made much of him, and felt that, like him, we were ships
without rudders and didn’t know how to run ourselves.
Especially was this the case with Phyllis, who needed
whip and spur to keep her in the harness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I ’clars to goodness I don’t know nothin’ now the
missus isn’t here to boss,” she said, as she sat on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>bench outside the cabin door, her feet stretched out in
front of her, her hands idly folded on her lap, her ironing
neglected and her irons cooling on the hearth.</p>

<p class='c014'>Only Norah kept her balance and went steadily on her
way, her shoes creaking a good deal and her sharp tongue
often lashing Phyllis when she got too far out of line.
For three or four months Norah staid with us and then,
as it was impossible for us to pay her the wages she had
been receiving, she left us for Boston. But not until she
had everything in what she called “apple pie order,” an
expression which, I think, must belong exclusively to the
east, as it was a favorite with Mrs. Hathern, and I have
never heard it elsewhere. Owing to her delicate health
Mrs. Hathern had deferred the spring cleaning, which
she intended to take in hand as soon as her illness was
over. But death snatched her away and it was left for
Norah to carry out her plans, which she did with a vengeance.
Everything was turned topsy-turvey, as it had
been the year before when Mrs. Hathern was the presiding
genius of brush and broom and soap suds. There
was, however, this difference, there were no carpenters
and masons and plumbers blocking the way, or hired
negroes either. Knowing the low state of our finances
Norah did everything herself with the little help
she could extort from Phyllis. That functionary had
taken to violent fits of short breath when there was more
than usual to do. “Physicy,” she called it, and she had it
badly now and wheezingly protested against so much useless
cleaning. A little dirt was healthy, she said, and
privately we sympathized with her, and were glad when
Norah told us that we needn’t go through with quite so
much in the fall. Boston folks didn’t as a rule.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wash the windows; wipe the fly-specks from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>paint; air everything, and give the rest a lick and a promise
and let it go till spring, when mabby I’ll visit you and
see to the annual clean myself,” she said. Then, as a
happy inspiration seized her, she added: “There are a few
things you must see to every day, and as I know you
won’t remember ’em all I’ll write ’em down.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The result of this was a long document so full of what
we were to do and not to do that I felt dizzy and bewildered
as I read it, and then passed it on to Fan, who,
with no fancy for housekeeping, threw it aside. This morning
while looking over a trunk of old papers I came
across that sheet of foolscap, written nearly thirty years
ago, yellow with age, blurred and blotted and wonderful
for composition and orthography. There were tear stains
upon it, too, as I re-read it and thought of all which had
happened since the autumnal day when Norah first brought
it to me and asked me to nail it up in the pantry where
it could be seen every day. I will give a few extracts:
“Fust and fornenst, don’t let Phyllis make a
pig-sty of my kitchen. I’ve kept it so clane that I can
<em>need bred</em> in it anywhere; don’t let her get pot black all
over the table, and greese on the floor; don’t let her leave
the kittles on the range till they bile dry, specially the
Te kittle. Ittle leek, and hev to be mended, an’t costs
money; an’ there an’t no Miss Hathern to pay the bills
now; don’t let her put the wash biler away till she’s wiped
it and the cover dry, or the close will be all iron rust;
don’t let her open all the draffs and pile the cole on till
the griddles is red hot, an’ the fire all going up the chimly.
Ittle warp ’em an’ spile the range. Make her hang up
the broom, or stand it on end. Ittle last longer. An’
ef I’se you, I wouldn’t use gilt ege chany every day as
Miss Hathern did. You’se them tothers. An’ don’t let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Phyllis jab her big black thum into that mended place on
the vegetable dish. Ittle break sure. An’ don’t let her
slat her things round everywhere in my nice kitchen. Tell
her Miss Hathern will appear to her some nite if she does.
That’ll fetch her. She’s afraid of spooks.”</p>

<p class='c014'>All this, and much more, Norah wrote, and I promised
to follow her instructions as well as I could. Then one
morning in October the ‘bus which had brought her to us
came to take her away. Lifting the baby from his cradle
she cried over and kissed him and, assuring us that he
was not long for this world, he looked so <em>pimpin</em>, she put
him back and said good-bye and went away, while we
watched her as far as we could see her with swelling
hearts and tearful eyes, wondering how we should get on
without her.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next morning I read her instructions to Phyllis.
She had moved her belongings from her cabin into the
kitchen, which already began to show signs of a new
administration. Seated upon an inverted wash tub she
listened to my reading with sundry snorts and shakes of
her head until her turban fell off and lay upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“For de Lord’s sake, chile, is you that soft to think
I can ‘member all dem things. No, sor; but nebber you
mind, honey, I’se no fool, if I is a brack nigger. I’se
kep’ my eyes open more’n you thinks an’ learned a heap
of dem Boston ways. You’ll see; don’t you worry, nor
come speerin’ ’round de kitchen. Jess stay in de parlor
whar ladies belong, an’ I’ll run de ranch! I’se cap’n
now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She adjusted her turban, picked up the mop and the
broom, put them together behind the door, where Norah’s
sunbonnet used to hang, and began to bustle about with
the activity of a young girl. Norah’s instructions I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>pinned up, as I said I should, but they were all lost on
Phyllis except the possibility of Mrs. Hathern’s return if
things were too much mixed; that troubled her. For
several nights when we were up with our baby we saw a
light in the cabin where she slept. When questioned
about it she owned to keeping a candle burning “So as
to see de missus if she comes. I’se not gwine to be took
unawares, nor be so unmanneredly as to let her stumble
roun’ in de dark.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, Phyllis,” Fan said, “if it is dark she can’t see
the litter.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dat’s so, honey, I hain’t thought of dat,” was Phyllis’s
rejoinder, and that night there was no candle burning
in Phyllis’s room, but the door we knew was barricaded
and the window nailed down to keep out Norah
quite as much as Mrs. Hathern.</p>

<p class='c014'>The superstitious old woman had been detected so
often by the former in her little attempts to deceive that
she had come to look upon her with a kind of awe as one
gifted with second sight, who might pounce upon her in
bodily shape quite as readily as Mrs. Hathern in ghostly
form. With Norah’s departure the last link was severed
which bound us to the new life, and I am ashamed to
confess how quickly and unconsciously we took up the old
one. It was so easy to do it, with Phyllis anticipating all
our wants and encouraging us in our indolence. We
breakfasted when we felt like it; had dinner and supper
at all hours, while the kitchen gradually came to look like
anything but a place where Norah could knead her bread
on the floor. Phyllis’s handiwork was everywhere. There
was pot black on the sink, and grease on the floor. Her
big black thumb had <em>jabbed</em> out the broken piece in the
vegetable dish, and the hot tomatoes had been spilled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>some on the carpet and some down Fan’s back. The wash
boiler had been discarded for an iron kettle, and was filled
with a variety of articles, conspicuous among which were
father’s boot-jack and blacking brush. The griddles on
the range were red most of the time and began to warp
and crack; the kettles burned dry; the tea kettle leaked
and was mended so often that father at last mildly protested,
saying it was cheaper to get a new one, which he
could ill afford as his bill at the hardware store was
already a large one. Then I tried to take the helm.
There were a good many battles with Phyllis, who, however,
succumbed so far as to have one day in each week
for <em>clarin up</em>, “and the Lord himself couldn’t ax more’n
that ef she was workin’ for him,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the midst of all our difficulties our baby was never
for a moment forgotten or neglected. Norah had called
him <em>pimpin</em>, by which she meant delicate, and so he was.
But he was a beautiful child, with wavy hair, and eyes a
cross between blue and gray, a complexion like wax and
the prettiest ways, which made us all his slaves. It was
Fan who devoted herself to him, while I wrestled with
the house. When he began to talk, her name, or an
attempt at it, was the first word he tried to speak. He
had often heard us spoken of as “<em>Fan-and-Ann</em>,” and
with a quickness and persistence for which he was remarkable,
he caught it and applied it to her alone. “<em>Fan-er-nan</em>”
he always called her, while, for some reason known
only to himself, I was <em>Annie-mother</em>, although I didn’t take
half the care of him that she did. As soon as we thought
he could understand we told him of his mother, and when
he asked us where she was Fan answered “In Paradise,”
and tried to make him repeat the word after her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, my lan!” came derisively from Phyllis, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>within hearing. She didn’t “b’lieve in ‘dat ar <em>pair-o’-dice</em>,’”
she said, and when next she was alone with the little fellow
she took him in her lap, gave him a lump of sugar and
said to him, “Don’t you let ’em fool you about dat ar
<em>pair-o’-dice</em>. Dar ain’t no sich place. Your mar’s sperrit
is in heaven, and her body in Boston.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After that he always insisted that his mother had gone
to heaven in Boston. He knew that Carl was in Boston,
and saw no reason why his mother should not be there
too. We told him a great deal of Carl, who became to him
a kind of imaginary hero, and whom he always remembered
in his prayers, asking that God would bless “brother
Tarl, make him a good boy, and keep him <em>straight</em>.” Mrs.
Hathern’s dying injunction had been “Keep Carl
straight,” and as we never saw him Fan hoped a baby’s
prayers might accomplish what we had no means of doing,
and taught the words to Paul. Carl was in Harvard, doing
fairly well for a young man of his means and tastes.
He had plenty of money, and was fond of luxury and
“larks,” and sometimes wrote us letters which made our
hair stand on end. It was usually Fan who took up the
cudgels and berated him for what she called his “goings
on.” He always answered good-humoredly, telling her
she was too prudish and knew nothing of the world, living
as she did in that out of the way place.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not that Lovering isn’t lovely,” he added, “and I’d
like nothing better than to live with you in the charming
old home I remember with so much pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He always addressed us as “My dear sisters,” and
signed himself, “Your loving brother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Words,—nothing but words, which are so cheap,”
Fan would say derisively. “If we are so dear, and the
old house so charming, why does he never come near us.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>I tell you there is something wrong about Carl. He is
fickle and fast.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I feared so, too; but there was a very warm spot in my
heart for Carl, whom I always defended, while Katy would
never hear a word of censure against him. He was her
hero as well as Paul’s, and she would rather he would be
fast than stupid, she said. Just before he was graduated
he sent a most cordial invitation for us all to come east
and see him take his degree.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have been in a good many scrapes,” he wrote, “but
have managed to slip out. I always have my lessons and
shall come off with some honor, and I want you here to
share it. So, pack up your best clothes. I shall want my
sisters to look well, and some of the Boston girls are stunners.
Bring Phyllis and the baby, and I will quarter you
all in my house in Boston, with Norah to superintend.
Did I tell you that I took the house when the last tenant’s
lease expired, and had it refurnished from top to
toe, and put Norah there to keep it for me? Quite a comfortable
bachelor’s home you will find it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, how I’d like to go,” I exclaimed, remembering
the pleasant house looking out upon the Common, and
feeling a great desire to see Boston and Carl again.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the thing was impossible. It was five years now
since Mrs. Hathern died, and every year we had been
growing poorer. Father’s practice was gone, or nearly
so, and the few thousands left him by his wife had been
drawn upon so many times that there was not much now
to draw from. The trip to Boston was not to be thought
of, and Fan answered the letter, declining the invitation.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was sorry, he wrote in reply, adding that as we were
not coming he should give a swell dinner in his house to
his classmates and have a “high old time.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>As it chanced Jack was in Boston on business and meeting
Carl accidentally was persuaded to be present at the
dinner, which surpassed anything he had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The flowers alone and decorations must have cost
hundreds of dollars,” he wrote to Fan; “and there were
dishes whose name I never heard before and which I never
care to taste again. Everyone was in evening dress but
myself, who felt rather countryfied and out of place in my
business clothes. But Carl was the same old kind-hearted
boy, and made me feel perfectly at home and treated me
as his honored guest. We sat down at nine and did not
get up till two in the morning. Even then some of them
did not get up at all for they were under the table, and
lying round loose anywhere, and I shouldn’t like to tell
Fan how many empty wine bottles were carried out by
the waiters; but this I will say, I turned my glass down
every time, although I know I was thought a milksop for
doing it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was at the time the great temperance crusade was
beginning to sweep over the land, and Fan was head and
front of the movement in Lovering. She had led a band
of women into some of the lowest saloons and been threatened
with eggs and brickbats, but had held her own
bravely and won respect and attention where, at first, she
met with coarse language and derisive jeers. Jack’s letter
roused her to a pitch of white heat and she wrote to
Carl, asking what his mother would say could she have
looked upon the drunken revel, and if he didn’t think
himself about as mean and low as he well could be for acting
so entirely at variance with his mother’s wishes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl’s reply was good-humored and apologetic. He
was a cad, he said, to break his promise to his mother,
but he positively had never been tipsy.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“I suppose, though, I can drink more than most fellows
and not be affected by it,” he wrote. “But that is
no excuse, and to prove that I am in earnest I have taken
the pledge and shall keep it, too, as bravely as Jack Fullerton
did that night. I never respected a man more in
my life than I did him, even while chaffing him a little and
calling him an old maid. He is the right kind of stuff,
and I don’t see why you don’t marry him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Carl’s advice is good,” I said. “Why don’t you
marry Jack?”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was an upward turn of Fan’s chin as she
answered me—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor, too poor. I can struggle with poverty at home
but when I have one of my own I must have some luxuries.
So I’ll wait awhile. I am only twenty-five, if old
Granny Baker did say at the sewing society that ‘it was
time them Hathern girls were married, as they are gettin’
to be old maids.’ Old maids, indeed! Do I look like
one?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She had never been more beautiful and attractive than
she was then in the full bloom of her womanhood. Jack
thought so, too, and often asked her to be his wife, while
she as often answered him in a manner which, while it did
not mean yes, certainly was not a decided no.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>
  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE FEVER.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That summer our town was visited with typhoid fever
in its most malignant form. Jack’s mother was among
the first to take it, and in their fear of the disease her
servants forsook her, and as nurses were scarce Jack was
left alone with her until Fan joined him and together they
cared for her until she died. A week later our father was
smitten with the terrible scourge, which found him an
easy prey. He had never been himself since Mrs. Hathern
died, and now it seemed to me as if he gladly lay down
upon the bed from which he was never to rise again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am so tired,—so tired!” he said, as he folded his
thin hands like a child going to sleep, and scarcely moved
or spoke again until toward the last when he asked that
we send for Carl. “I want to see him,” he said;
“there’s something very winsome about Carl, and I must
talk to him about the little boy!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Jack, who had been with us all the time, hiding his own
pain to comfort us, telegraphed to Carl’s address in Boston.
It was Norah who replied, and her answer was so
like her that we could not repress a smile as we read it:
“He is scurripin’ around the country, the Lord only
knows where, but I’ll find him,—sure.”</p>

<p class='c014'>When we told father he said very faintly, “I shall not
be here when he comes, but tell him that I have loved
him like a son, and he must avoid temptation. He is
easily lead. Tell him, too, about the boy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>All the next day and the next we watched for some
message from Carl, but none came. The third day, however,
a telegram reached us from Norah saying, “I’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>run him down at last in Canada.” That evening there was
another from Carl, saying, “Shall start to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Oh, how hard our father tried to live until Carl reached
us. It was a fierce struggle between death and an
indomitable will, and it was a question which would conquer.
Jack kept up his courage and ours.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If he left Boston at nine, as he probably did, he is in
New York by this time,” he would say; and, later on,
“He is in Washington now, and will be in Richmond to-morrow
morning;” then the line of prevision was broken
and we knew no more until the next day at noon, when
there came a message from Richmond: “Train late.
Have just arrived. Will be with you at four. Carl.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan read it to our father, whose eyes shone for a moment
with an eager light, while his paralyzed tongue tried
to speak. But he had drifted too far away for anything
to hold him longer, and when the old clock in the church
tower struck one he was dead. I cannot describe our
anguish as we kissed his cold, white face in the last good-bye,
while his eyes, to the very last, looked so lovingly
at us and his pale lips tried to whisper his farewell. Even
now, after many years, my heart throbs with pain as every
incident of that day comes back to me. The warm sunshine,
the scent of the flowers, the song of the robin, the
hum of the bees, the low murmur of voices in the room
where the undertaker and his assistants were at work,
Jack going in and out, occasionally consulting us but
mostly doing what he thought best, and later on going
with the phaeton and Black Beauty to meet Carl, while
Fan and I sat on the piazza waiting for him just as we
waited years before when he surprised us by coming on
foot across the field and in at the rear door. Now he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>came more decorously, with Paul in his lap, one arm
around his neck and his curly head nestling on Carl’s
shoulder, while he talked continually. Paul had gone
with Jack to the station, eager to meet his brother; but
when a tall young man, dressed in the height of fashion,
stepped upon the platform and came briskly towards him,
he drew back, until Jack said, “That’s he that’s your
brother; go and speak to him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he ran forward and looking shyly up at the stranger,
said, “Is you my brother Carl? I’m Paul, and
papa’s dead and Fan-er-Nan and Annie-mother and Katy
has cried themselves sick.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With the exception of a few presents at Christmas and an
occasional mention of him in his letters Carl had never
evinced any interest in Paul. But no one could withstand
that upturned face and the little hands held out in welcome,
and lifting the child in his arms Carl kissed him
lovingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I’m Carl,” he said, “and your brother, if you
are really Paul; but, zounds! how you have grown. I
have imagined you still a baby. What a stupid I must
be.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After that the acquaintance progressed rapidly, and the
two were on the best of terms by the time the phaeton
drew up to the door and Carl sprang out to meet us.
The same Carl in some respects we had known as a boy,
and in others so very different. Broad-shouldered, perfectly
formed, six feet tall, with a heavy mustache, and
an unmistakable <i><span lang="fr">air distingué</span></i>, he impressed us for a moment
as he had little Paul, and I felt half afraid of him.
That feeling, however, vanished the moment I heard his
voice, full of sympathy, as he kissed us and said, “I am
sorry that I did not get here sooner. I’d give so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>to see him alive once more. He was the best man I ever
knew.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was crying and could not answer him. Just what
Fan said I do not know, until I heard her exclaim, “Katy
Hathern, why are you here? I told you not to get up.”
Aside from the grief at the loss of our father there was a
terrible fear haunting us lest Katy was coming down
with the fever. For two or three days she had complained
of her head, and just after father died she had been
seized with a nervous chill. The doctor, whom we called
at once, had ordered her to bed, and his face was very
grave as he prescribed for her. She had refused to go to
bed, saying she was only tired; but we persuaded her to
lie down upon the couch in her room where I supposed
she was until I saw her standing in the doorway, her eyes
unusually bright and a deep flush upon her cheeks. She
had been very small as a child, seeming younger than she
really was; but within the last two or three years she had
shot up rapidly, until at fifteen she was taller than either
Fan or myself, with the loveliest face I have ever seen.
Fan was beautiful, with a brilliant, glowing beauty like
the gorgeous flowers of autumn, while Katy was fair as a
lily, with a complexion like the pink-and-white shells
fresh from the sea. Her eyes were large and blue as a
bit of summer sky, the heavy brows and long lashes making
them seem darker than they really were. Her hair,
once almost yellow, was now a golden brown, with auburn
tints upon it when seen in certain lights, and fell in curls
upon her neck. No stranger ever looked at Katy once
that did not look again, and now, as she appeared in the
doorway, the purity of her complexion heightened by the
black dress she wore, and her lips parted with a smile of
welcome to Carl, it was not surprising that he sprang to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>his feet exclaiming, “Great Scott! This can’t be Katy!
Why, I’ve always thought of you as a little girl in pantelets
tumbling into the frog pond, and by Jove! I’ve
brought you a <em>doll</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He had both her hands in his and was looking at her
with eyes which seemed to take in every point of beauty
and gloat over it as over some rare treasure found unexpectedly.
He had kissed Fan and me, but he did not
kiss Katy. Possibly she saw the glowing fire in his eyes
which I saw, and did not like it, or it might have been
the mention of the <em>doll</em> which put her upon her dignity,
and when he stooped as if to kiss her she drew her head
back with a sideways movement natural to her when surprised
or displeased. She was very gracious to him, however,
and let him lead her to a seat while he sat down
beside her and talked, to us, still looking at her as if he
would never tire of her fair girlish beauty. Then suddenly
the color left her face, her head began to droop, and finally
rested on his shoulder. She had fainted from her weakness
and over-exertion. It was Carl who carried her up
stairs and laid her upon the bed, from which she did not
rise again until the summer was on the wane and there
was a foreshadowing of the September haze upon the hills
and woods of Lovering.</p>

<p class='c014'>What passed during the next few days after Katy’s faint
was very vague and misty. I seemed like one in a horrible
nightmare, my heart torn with anguish for the living
and sorrow for the dead. The latter we buried with as
little ceremony as possible. Letters of sympathy we had
in abundance, but many of our friends were ill and others
were too much afraid of the terrible scourge to come near
us when they heard there was a fresh case in our midst.
So, only the clergyman, the bearers, Jack, Paul, Fan and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>myself and Phyllis went across the field to the hillside
where, under the pines, we buried our father beside
Charlie and The Boy. Even Carl was not with us. Katy
had been delirious from the first and clung to him as if
he were her mother. She knew the moment he left the
room and was only quiet when he sat by her, as he did
almost constantly, scarcely giving himself time to eat or
sleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We can’t let Katy die,” he said, and everything
which could be done to save the life so dear to us was
done.</p>

<p class='c014'>We had a trained nurse from Richmond and a physician
who came every other day, while the doctor from Lovering
came almost every hour, it seemed to me. This was
Carl’s idea. He had taken the matter in charge and
was spending his money like water. We had a colored
woman in the kitchen to help Phyllis and he would have
hired another if we had let him. Incidentally, we learned
that a party of friends were waiting for him to join them
in Montreal. But he telegraphed to them, “My sister is
very ill and I cannot come.” He called her his sister,
but his manner towards her was that of the tenderest of
lovers. Many times I saw him kiss her forehead when
she was more than usually restless, and once he pressed
his lips to hers, from which the feverish breath came
scorchingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you not afraid?” I asked, and he answered promptly,
“Afraid? No. Nothing about Katy can be infectious,
and I would kiss her if I knew I should have the
fever a hundred times.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We tried in vain to keep Paul from the room. He was
perfectly infatuated with Carl, who, in his absorption,
paid little attention to the child. But that did not matter.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Paul was not to be repressed. He would put his
little hands into Carl’s and hold it fast until the young
man was compelled to notice him. By some means unknown
to us he had unearthed the high chair in which
Katy had done penance so many times, and dragging it
into the sick-room placed it where it would be most out
of the way. Here he would sit in spite of us, watching
Carl as he bent over the fever-stained face and restless
head upon the pillow.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Does you sink God will let Katy die?” he once asked,
as the disease progressed and the hope in our hearts was
nearly gone.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, she shall not die!” Carl answered, fiercely, and
Paul continued, “I prays every night and morning that
God will make her well. Does you pray, broder Carl?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Paul, I am too wicked to pray. God wouldn’t
hear me, but he will you. Keep on, and if she lives I’ll
give you a much prettier riding pony than Black Beauty
ever was,” Carl said.</p>

<p class='c014'>After that, when Paul was not in the sick-room, we
found him on his knees at all hours of the day praying
that Katy might live.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And she will, you bet,” he horrified me by saying, as
he came from a dark corner where he had been earning
his pony.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Paul! Where did you get that dreadful word?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Fan who explained. That morning as she was
entering Katy’s room, she saw Carl stoop to kiss the sick
girl and heard Paul, who was as usual seated in his high
chair, ask “Does you love her very much?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You <em>bet</em>,” was the answer inadvertently given; then,
as he met Fan’s eyes full of reproach, Carl hastened to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>say, “I beg your pardon. You see we fellows use a lot
of slang when alone, and it came from me unawares. I
hope that you will excuse me, and that no harm is done.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was looking at Paul, who had caught the expression,
as he caught everything out of the common, and who,
in spite of our remonstrances, used it continually until Fan
shut him up in the meal room, from which he emerged
penitent and cured.</p>

<p class='c014'>For weeks Katy hovered between life and death and
went so far down the dark valley that we once thought
she had left us forever. But she came back again, and
after a few days it became evident that the crisis was past
and she would live if her strength was sufficient for the
struggle. For days she lay perfectly still with her eyes
closed and her face as white as the pillow her shorn head
rested upon. We had cut off her hair when her fever and
delirium were at their height, for it seemed to trouble her,
and she looked like a little child again, with her thin face
and short curls clustering around her forehead. Suddenly
one evening when we thought her sleeping, she opened
her eyes and looked wonderingly at us. Then in a voice
so low that we could scarcely hear her, she said, “What
has happened, and why are you all in here, and why am I
in bed? Am I very ill?” Then as her eyes fell upon
Carl they lighted up with something of their old brilliancy,
and her voice was steadier as she said, “Oh, Carl,
you here? Yes, I remember now; but it seems so long
ago.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, darling, I am here,” Carl said, laying his hand
on her white cheeks, which flushed quickly.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were scarlet a moment later when Paul, who had
climbed upon the bed, chimed in: “He’s been here ever
so long and tissed you, oh so many times, I seen him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>once he cried when he so’t you was dead, and he’s goin’
to div me an ittle pony ’cause I prayed so much for God
to make you well. I love Carl, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He had blurted out everything, and I glanced nervously
at Carl to see how he would take it. He only laughed
and said something about “Little pitchers telling all they
knew,” and adding, “Why shouldn’t a fellow kiss his sister
if he wants to?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Instantly Katy’s eyes looked searchingly into his with
an expression which told me that for her had commenced
the old, old story, which has gone on since Adam and Eve
first dwelt in Eden, and will go on as long as there is a
tongue to tell it, or an ear to listen to it. But how was
it with Carl, the young man of the world, with unbounded
wealth at his command and his choice of any fair girl
in the set to which he belonged? Did he really care for
Katy, except as a brother might care for a sister as lovely
as she was? and if he cared now, was he not of too fickle
a nature to carry her image with him until time had developed
her from a girl of fifteen into a full-grown woman?</p>

<p class='c014'>Rumors had come to us in various ways of numerous
flirtations which meant nothing to him and were dropped
as soon as the first glamour was worn away and there were
fresh fields to glean. From what we had seen of him we
could understand how with his face and voice and manner
he had only to stretch out his hand and gather almost any
flower, just to inhale its sweetness for an hour and then
drop it for another. Would he trifle with our Katy, or
was it really only a brother’s affection he was giving to
her? These questions Fan and I asked ourselves many
times during the days of Katy’s convalescence, when Carl
was with her so constantly, and we saw the brightness in
her eyes when he came into her room, bringing fruit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>and flowers and books to read, but, most of all, bringing
himself. There were drives in the leafy woods as
she grew stronger, and walks to the cemetery on the hill
side, where we often saw them sitting side by side upon
the seat under the pines, his arm sometimes around her
waist and her head upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is he making love to her, and shall we let it go
on? She is too young,” Fan would say, and calling Paul
she would give him some flowers for the graves and tell
him he might stay as long as he chose.</p>

<p class='c014'>The chances were that Paul, who always wanted to go
where Carl and Katy went, had already been there and
been gotten rid of in some way, but delighted with his commission
he would start across the field to execute it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Halloo, youngster, who told you to come here after
I sent you back?” Carl said to him once, when Katy’s
hand lay in his and her eyes were shining like diamonds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fan-er-Nan send me,” Paul replied. “I’ve bringed
flowers for papa’s grave an’ Charlie’s an’ The Boy’s, an’
my two first mammas, an’ I’m goin’ to stay.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A few incidents like this broke up the walks to the
cemetery, and, as if divining our suspicions, Carl’s manner
to Katy changed a little and was more like that of a
brother than of a lover. Katy was not one who carried
her thoughts on her face, or talked much of her inner feelings.
She was more reticent and self-contained than
either Fan or myself, and if she noticed a change in Carl
she gave no sign of it. But when about the middle of
September he told us one morning at breakfast that he
had letters from Boston requiring his immediate presence
there, and that he must start the next day, her checks
where the roses were beginning to bloom again became a
shade paler, and there was a troubled look in her eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>whenever they rested on Carl. He seemed very cheerful
and went whistling about the house as he made his
preparations for his departure. He had paid every bill
contracted during Katy’s illness, had bought a pretty
white pony for Paul as a reward for his prayers, and done
many things for our comfort.</p>

<p class='c014'>That night,—the last he was to spend with us,—Fan
found an opportunity to speak to him alone, reminding
him of his mother’s dying message and what our father
had said of his being easily influenced. With a laugh in
which there was some bitterness, he replied, “Oh, bother,
don’t you fear for me. I’m all right. Lots of us fellows
have sprees but we do nothing bad. I shall sow my wild
oats early and settle into a model married man. You’ll
see!”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a thought of Katy in Fan’s mind, and she
replied, “Not for years yet; and, Carl, be careful what
kind of girls you consort with. Choose the purest and
best. Remember that your mother said, ‘If Carl falls,
it will be a woman that tempts him.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then for the first time Carl showed real irritation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who has been talking to you?” he said. “Has that
old cat, Miss Errington, of Washington, been writing
things to you? She was in Boston last winter and I met
her several times. She was visiting in a house where I
often called; there were three pretty girls there and once
they chaffed me before her about a French grisette with
whom they said I corresponded. It was just this way;
you remember Julina?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” Fan said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” Carl continued, “she wrote me a letter in
French. She has been in Paris five years and must be
perfect in the language. She was with her aunt, Madame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Du Bois, who keeps a pension. She addressed me as
‘My dear Carl,’ and signed herself ‘Your devoted Julina.’
I am so poor a French scholar that I couldn’t make it
all out, and got a fellow to help me, and by Jove he told
of it to these girls as a joke on me, and I was hectored
until I almost hated the name Julina. I didn’t answer
her letter; upon my word I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know nothing about Julina and care less,” Fan
replied, “but Miss Errington did write me that you were
something of a flirt, and I should know that if she had
not written it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Again Carl seemed irritated and answered warmly, “I
don’t know what you mean. Can’t a fellow enjoy himself
with a pretty girl who enjoys herself with him? I like
them all, and the one I am with last I like the best. It
is my nature. I can’t help it; but I’d burn my hands to
the bone before I would wrong any girl, or knowingly
deceive her. I have given no woman reason to think my
attentions more than those of a friend, and if she thought
so it was her own fault and because she did not understand
me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this moment Katy entered the room. She had
heard his last words, and there was a look of surprise
in her eyes for a moment; then they suddenly hardened
and her manner was more like that of a Grande Duchesse
than our simple-hearted Katy as she took the chair he
brought her, and bending over her with his hand on her
shoulder stroked her hair and said, “You look pale, are
you tired?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Leaning her head against the back of the chair Katy
closed her eyes as if she were tired, but really to repress
the tears which in her weak state came so easily.
Months after, when Carl’s letters, at first so long and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>frequent, had become like angel’s visits, “short and far
between,” she said to me, hesitatingly, “I thought Carl
liked me just as Jack likes Fanny. He never said so,
it is true, but he acted it, and I was pleased and happy.
There is something about him which wins you in spite of
yourself. Hypnotism, perhaps. But I am over it now. I
know he does not care for me as I did for him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She spoke sadly, and I felt a throb of indignation
against Carl, who had, unwittingly, perhaps, thrown a
shadow on Katy’s life. She was young in years, but old
in much which makes mature womanhood, and the attentions
of a man like Carl could not fail to impress her with
a deeper feeling than sisters feel for brothers. He still
wrote her occasionally,—bright, chatty letters, full of
protestations of affection for herself and all of us, and
telling her of a life of which she knew nothing. But he
didn’t come again, and he seemed at last to have passed
out of our lives, into which another exciting interest had
entered.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE ENGAGEMENT.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>The winter succeeding father’s death was a hard one
for us. Our effort to economize and still not seem to do
so was a struggle, and probably did not deceive anyone.
Jack understood all our needs and straits and helped us
wherever he could,—not in money, but in many ways
where a man’s advice and assistance are invaluable. He
was now agent for a large firm which paid him well, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>as he was traveling only a part of the time we saw a
great deal of him, and the evenings when he was not with
us seemed monotonous and long. Sometimes when the
days were fine and he had leisure for it he took long walks
with Fan in the woods, and when they came back I used
to notice a brightness in his manner and a look in Fan’s
eyes which I had not seen there before. Christmas week
and the one following he was in town, negotiating a sale
for his mother’s house. When he left it was early on the
morning train, and that night, when Fan and I were alone in
our room and she was brushing her glossy hair, she
turned suddenly to me and said, “I have promised to
marry Jack. Didn’t you notice that he looked more like
an idiot than usual?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was standing by my dressing bureau with my back
to her, so that she could not see the whiteness of my face
as I put my hand upon my heart, where for a moment
there was the sharpest pain I had ever known or ever
shall again. I had expected this would come sometime
and I thought I was prepared, but now that it had come,
I found myself a weak, wicked woman, loving a man who
was to marry my sister, and who, under no circumstances,
could ever have cared for me. Rallying in a moment
and laughing at her likening him to an idiot, I replied,
“You forget I have not seen him since I left you with
him last night in the parlor and went to bed with a headache.
I suppose it was after I came up stairs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” she nodded, and after a moment went on;
“What a great awkward baby of a fellow he is. Why
he almost cried when I consented to marry him, and went
off into a tantrum which frightened me and made me
half wish I hadn’t said yes. I do believe if I were to go
back on him now it would kill him.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“Go back on him!” I said. “You could never do that.
Go back on Jack; the best and noblest man that ever
lived!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She had drawn her long hair across her face, and
through it her black eyes looked curiously at me as she
said, “I believe <em>you</em> are in love with Jack, or could easily
be, and I wish it were you instead of me. Don’t stare at
me as if you thought me a fiend. I like him; sometimes
I think I love him. I dare say I should love him desperately
if there were any danger of losing him, but I can’t
help wishing he had more style, and more money. He is
a gentleman, of course, but he has not the manner of
Carl or Col. Errington. Half a dozen times I have been
on the point of accepting the latter. You know his letter
is still unanswered; but, you don’t know that in his letter
of sympathy after father died there was a slip I did
not show you. Just four words, “Are you still considering?”
That shows he has remembered all these years, and
since we have had so hard a struggle with poverty my
thoughts have more than once turned to him, or rather
to what he could give me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fan Hathern!” I exclaimed, indignantly. “You are
not worthy the love of a good man like Jack, and I am
half tempted to tell him so.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish you would; but you needn’t knock things
over before you do it,” she answered, with the utmost unconcern,
as in my excitement I ran against the table on
which the lamp was standing. “You know the plateau
on the hill where the Ponsonby mansion stood before it
was burned?” she continued. “Well, it is for sale, and
Jack is going to buy it and build a pretty cottage on it
with all the modern improvements. He was just like a
boy talking about it. He has more money than I supposed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>or will have, when his mother’s estate is settled,
and his salary is good. So we shall begin housekeeping
in fine style for Lovering, but—bah, nothing to what I
would like.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was never so angry with Fan in my life as I was that
night when she showed me the heartless side of her, and
I staid angry for two or three days until Jack came with
a plan for the cottage he was going to build on the Ponsonby
plateau. Then I forgave her when I saw her eyes
light up as she lifted her face to be kissed and sat down
close to him, while with one arm around her waist he explained
the plan to us both. It was as nearly perfect as
could be, especially the square hall with the fireplace,
the deep window seats and the broad staircase, with the
landing where his mother’s tall clock was to stand.
There were to be bay windows and alcoves and verandas,
above and below, and a room for Katy, and Paul, and myself
whenever we chose to stay there, which he hoped
would be very often. He <em>was</em> like a boy in his enthusiasm
and Fan caught the spirit, too, and began to furnish
the different rooms in a manner which took my breath
away. Jack had thought to use some of his mother’s furniture,
but Fan promptly vetoed the idea. It was too old
fashioned, she said. She must have everything fresh
and new, and she fitted up room after room, one with
pink, one with blue, one with red. Her own, with the
bay window overlooking the town and the valley and
hills beyond, was to be of white enameled wood, with
touches of gold here and there, while the window itself
was bewildering with its white silk canopy and fringe of
gold, its fleecy curtains and soft cushioned window stools
and chairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>If Jack had known Fan as well as I did he would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>understood that much of her talk was for effect, that she
never expected to have a house furnished as she was
furnishing it in fancy. Unfortunately, he was apt to take
things literally, and as he saw his pocket-book emptied
and himself heavily in debt if he carried out her plans,
he gasped a little and said, “That would be lovely, but I
am afraid I can’t afford it all at first. Sometime we will
have it, but now we must cut the garment according to
the cloth.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Instantly Fan’s face clouded. She lost her interest in
the plan, and nearly lost it in Jack, who was, however,
too supremely happy to notice it. She had promised to
be his wife the next Christmas, when the house which
was now on paper would be ready for her, and knowing
that he would sooner die than break his word to her, he
believed in and trusted her, and I never saw any human
being more happy than he seemed on the nights when he
used to come to us, bringing so much sunshine with his
kindness and thoughtfulness that the winter did not seem
half as long and dreary as we thought it would be with
our father gone. We missed him everywhere, it is true;
but as far as possible Jack filled his place, planning for
us, transacting all our business, and collecting many a
dollar which but for him we could never have recovered.
Occasionally we heard from Carl, who wrote that he was
studying law and was as steady as an old clock. Once
Norah wrote asking if Phyllis had done this and that and
presuming she hadn’t. Then she spoke of Carl, of whom
she was very proud. “About the firstest young man in
Boston,” she said, “with all the girls after him. But he
don’t seem to hanker in particular for none of ’em. He
has a way, though, of makin’ ’em all b’lieve she’s the
one. But, good land, ’taint wuth no girl’s while to set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>her heart on him. He’s like a wind-mill, turnin’ and turnin’.
He’s stiddy, though, and keeps middlin’ good hours—for
Boston.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was encouraging so far as Carl was concerned, but
there was a shadow on Katy’s face, and for several days
we missed the music of her voice as she moved rather dejectedly
around the house, apparently pondering Norah’s
words, “Tain’t wuth no girl’s while to set her heart on
Carl.”</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>Owing to some defect found in the title to the Ponsonby
plateau after Jack had bargained for it, there was
a delay of two or three months and it was the first of
June before the way was clear for him to begin his new
house. As he meant to superintend it himself and work
with his own hands as much as possible there was ample
time to finish it before Christmas, the day appointed for
the wedding. After many consultations and a great deal
of walking around the plateau to get the very best point
for views in every direction, it was decided to build the
cottage a little to the north of the spot where the Ponsonby
house had stood. This necessitated a new cellar,
and on the morning when the work was to commence
Jack came to us and said, “I wish you’d all come up and
see the first furrow turned. It will be something like
laying the corner stone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As the day was one of Phyllis’s “clarin’ up” days we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>were glad to escape from the discomfort of it, and deciding
to have a kind of picnic we took our lunch with us,
and sitting down on a bit of broken wall in the shadow of
a dogwood tree Katy, Paul and I looked on while Fan
and Jack steadied the plow and drove the horses around
the ground staked out for the cellar.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t this make you think of Romulus and Remus
building Rome? I don’t believe, though, that Jack will
kill me if I jump over the wall,” Fan said, laughingly, as
she let go the plow and bounding over the furrow came
up to where we were sitting, flushed with exercise and
seemingly very happy.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the horses had done all they could and the workmen
had taken the cellar in hand we sat down to our
lunch, which was nearly finished when we heard the sound
of voices coming up the hill and a moment after a gentleman
and lady came into view, walking very leisurely, but
quickening their steps when they saw us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Colonel and Miss Errington,” Fan exclaimed. “What
evil genius sent them here to-day!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Was it an evil genius, or good, or was it fate which sent
them there? I often asked myself afterwards, when a
great happiness and a great sorrow followed as the
result of their coming.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here you are! What a climb, and how tired and hot
I am,” Miss Errington said, as, after shaking hands with
us, she dropped down upon the nearest big stone and
began to fan herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was years since we had seen either the Colonel or his
sister, but it did not seem to me that they had changed
much. Both were a little stouter, perhaps, and there were
a few white hairs in the Colonel’s side-whiskers, worn
after the English fashion. Otherwise he was the same tall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>elegant man, with a military look and air, and the same
cold, hard expression in his eyes which, as they had
always done, softened when they rested on Fan. Every
color became her, but to me she had never been as handsome
as since she had worn black. It toned down her
brilliant color, and made her look more womanly and
lovable. That day her dress was a thin muslin, which
showed her white neck and arms, and she had pinned
some white roses at her throat and fastened some in her
hair “to scratch Jack when he tries to kiss me,” she
said, but really because she inwardly chafed against black
and wanted some color to relieve it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Colonel was very polite to me, and said to Katy,
“Upon my soul, how you have grown!” and “What
little shaver is this?” to Paul. Then he took Fan’s hand
and held it much longer than he had held mine, and
looked at her until she shrank from him and moved nearer
to Jack. Miss Errington was explaining that, as they
were in Richmond and had not seen us in years, they had
decided to surprise us with a call.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We drove from the station to the house,” she said,
“and found your factotum, Phyllis, asleep on the front
piazza with mop and pails and broom at her side. It was
a work of time to rouse her, but when she was fairly
awake she was profuse in her excuses, saying she was
that tired in her bones that she “had done drapped asleep
arsidentally,” and also that you were all digging the cellar
for Mas’r Jack’s and Miss Fanny’s new house, from
which I infer that congratulations are <i><span lang="fr">en règle</span></i>, or are you
already married?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, oh no!” Fan exclaimed, while Jack put his hand
on her shoulder with an air of proud ownership and said,
“Not yet, but I invite you to our wedding next Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Christmas! That’s a long way off,” the Colonel rejoined,
his manner changing at once from one of indifference,
or disappointment, or both, to one almost hilarious.
I was told that I looked younger than when he last saw
me. Katy was delicately complimented on her wonderful
beauty. Paul was taken up and set upon the highest bit
of wall, which he made believe was a horse, and Fan was
reminded of the saucy things she said to him when he
first invaded our house as a Federal officer with his soldiers,
and asked if she hated them all now as much as she did then.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should if they came on the same errand,” was her
reply, and then walking slowly around the broken ground
the Colonel asked if <em>that</em> was to be the size of the house?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, and you’d be surprised to know how much room
there will be in it,” Jack said, beginning eagerly to explain
that here was the hall, there the dining-room, there the
library and sitting-room, and “upstairs, right here, with
the bay window, where we get the finest view, our
room,” he added, with a world of love and tenderness on
the words <em>our room</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, yes, I see; all very fine,” the Colonel rejoined,
with a look I did not like, it seemed so like the look a
snake might give the bird it meant to destroy. “And
what do you intend to call this Paradise? You Southerners,
like the English, usually have names for your places,”
was his next question, to which Jack replied, “We
haven’t thought so far as that. The people who used to
live here called the place The Plateau, but I’d like something
else. Suppose you name it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How would ‘The House that Jack built’ do?” the
Colonel said, in an ironical tone which irritated me, but
which was lost sight of by the rest because of Paul, who,
catching the words “The House that Jack built,” began
at once to repeat the rhyme which he knew by heart.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“Bravo, young man!” the Colonel said, patting the
child’s head, while Fan suggested that we return to The
Elms, where we could offer a cup of tea to our guests.</p>

<p class='c014'>Jack excused himself, as he must stay with his men,
and the rest of us went slowly down the hill, Miss Errington,
Katy, Paul and myself in advance, the Colonel and
Fan in the rear, walking very slowly and engaged in what
seemed a very animated conversation. Phyllis had
finished her “clarin’ up,” donned her Sunday dress and
turban, and in anticipation of our return was moulding
biscuits for tea. It was served on the rear porch, where
the clematis and honeysuckle shielded us from the heat
of the June sun, and after it was over Miss Errington
asked Katy to sing for her. The song was followed by
another and another, during which the Colonel, who cared
little for music, walked up and down the long piazza
with Fan, whose cheeks were very red when she at last
joined us at my call.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Errington was going to Saratoga in August and
would like to take Katy with her if Fan and I were willing.
As all important decisions were usually left to Fan
I beckoned her to us. Before she could reply to the
proposition, which Miss Errington repeated, the Colonel
interposed, “That’s a capital idea, but why not invite
Miss Fanny also? You can chaperon two young ladies as
well as one, and I am sure she would like to see something
of the north she affects to hate.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This suggestion was warmly seconded by Miss Errington,
while Fan stood irresolute. I did not think she
would accept without seeing Jack, and was surprised when
she said at last, “I should like it so much if Miss Errington
really wants me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Errington did want her, and as I was not consulted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>it was arranged that Fan and Katy should go to
Washington the last week in July and from there to Saratoga
in company with Miss Errington. Nothing had been
said of the Colonel’s going, and when I asked what he
meant to do, he replied, “Oh, stay at home; Saratoga is
not to my taste.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was later than usual that night when Jack came to
us, more tired than I had ever seen him. He had worked
harder than any of his men, he said, as he leaned back in
his chair and asked where Fan was. She was putting Paul
to bed, and it was Katy who told him of the proposed trip.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fanny going!” he repeated, his face flushing for a
moment, and then turning paler than before. She had
just come in, and going up to him began to smooth his
hair and forehead, saying, “You poor boy, you are all
tired out. You ought not to work so hard. Let those
lazy negroes do it. Yes, I thought I’d go; it is a good
chance to see a little of the world before I settle down
into a Joan. You don’t care, do you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was still manipulating his hair, with her face very
near to his and something so coaxing in her voice that a
man less in love than Jack would have yielded to it and
granted what she wished.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am glad to have you go, if it pleases you,” he said.
“Only I thought you might like to be here and watch
the house as it progresses. But you’ll be back before
we get to the rooms.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes,” she answered very promptly. “I shall be
back before you reach the rooms. It is only for August,
and I have always wanted to see Saratoga.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is the Colonel going?” Jack asked and Fan answered,
“No, indeed, and I’m glad; I think him horrid and so
patronizing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The fact that the Colonel was not to make one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>party reconciled Jack to Fan’s absence more than anything
else, and in spite of his fatigue he grew very cheerful and
quite like himself as the evening wore on. That night
in our room there was a spirited discussion between Fan
and myself with regard to her proposed trip, I arguing
that for Jack’s sake she should stay at home, and she
declaring she would not. It was the only bit of life she’d
ever see, she said, and she meant to take it. She’d never
been beyond the smoke of our chimney, and after she was
married she should of course settle down, just as all the
Lovering women did, into a domestic drudge. Poverty
was hateful, and she was glad she was for once going to
know how rich people lived and play rich herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next morning she was very pliable and sweet, and
spent half the day at The Plateau with Jack whom she
brought home with her to supper, and then sat with him
alone on the piazza until the clock struck eleven and old
Phyllis appeared on the scene in wonderful night-gear,
with a tallow dip in her hand, saying she “had done hearn
sunthin’, and thought mebby thar was burgles in the
house.”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>SEEING THE WORLD.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was the last week in July when Fan and Katy left us
for Washington. Jack, Paul and I went to the station with
them, waving and kissing our hands to them as long as
we could see them standing upon the rear platform and
waving to us. How often now do I recall Fanny as she
was then starting out to see the world. Although twenty-six
she scarcely looked more than twenty, so lightly had
the years touched her bright face and starry eyes, which
tears made softer and lovelier as she said good-bye to
us. With wonderful skill and some help from the fashion
plates she had remodeled her wardrobe, adding a little to
it as we could afford, but refusing the money Jack offered
her, saying he knew she must need it and he wanted her
to hold her own among the fashionables she was to meet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, Jackey, dear,” she said, “I can’t take money
from you now; but when I am your wife, it will not be
safe to offer it to me. And don’t you worry, I shall hold
my own.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At first she wrote three times a week to Jack, and her
letters were very satisfactory, judging from his manner
after receiving them. To me she wrote once a week, but
it was from Katy that I had the most reliable information.
They had reached Washington safely, and been met by
Colonel and Miss Errington in a superb turnout, with coachman
and footman in livery. The house was more elegant
than anything Katy had ever imagined, and all its appointments
of service and servants were perfect, and Fan
adapted herself to everything with the air of a duchess
born to the purple. Both the Colonel and his sister were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>very kind and had taken them everywhere in and around
Washington, which was a beautiful city, but so hot that
after a week’s sojourn they were glad to leave it for Saratoga.
At the very last moment the Colonel had decided
to go with them. He had said he couldn’t be hired to
spend a month in that frivolous place, but when in the
morning they came down to breakfast there was his baggage
with theirs in the hall waiting for the expressman,
and he was in his light traveling suit giving directions.
They were stopping at the United States, where they had
a suite of rooms on the second floor, parlor, three bedrooms,
dressing-rooms and bath-rooms, and were quite
the distinguished guests of the house. After she had
been in Saratoga two or three weeks Katy wrote again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We know everybody worth knowing and everybody
knows us and are very polite and attentive, notwithstanding
our plain black gowns, which contrast so strongly with
the elegant dresses worn morning, noon and night, any
one of which must have cost more than all our simple
wardrobe. There is a story going the rounds that we
were very wealthy before the war,—that being on the
frontier we were overrun by both armies, our house
burned, our negroes stolen, and that we lost all we had.
Fan, they say, was a fierce rebel, and with a revolver once
kept Col. Errington and his whole regiment at bay when
he tried to quarter his men upon us. All this fiction
seems to make the people think more of us. Funny, isn’t
it? Fan is the belle of the season and more flattered and
complimented and sought after than any young lady here.
And you don’t know how beautiful she is even in her
simple black lawn and linen collar, with her brilliant complexion,
her eyes like diamonds and her smile which
brings every man to her feet. You ought to see her sitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>in one of the big chairs on the piazza, or in the hall,
surrounded by half a dozen admirers of all ages from sixteen
to sixty. She knows the right word to say to each
one, and keeps them all on the <i><span lang="fr">qui vive</span></i>, while the Colonel,
who is always very near, looks on with an expression
which says as plain as words can say, ‘Don’t go too far,
gentlemen. It will do no good.’ His attentions are
constant and so delicate and marked that people begin to
associate their names together, and I have been asked if
they were not engaged. I said no, decidedly, and told
them about Jack, whom she is to marry at Christmas.
In less than twenty-four hours, so fast does gossip travel
here, I overheard one lady tell another that the eldest
Miss Hathern was engaged to a wealthy Virginia planter
who lived near Richmond.</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘That splendid girl engaged to a farmer,’ the second
lady exclaimed, and her friend replied, ‘No, a planter.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Oh, that will do,’ the other said, in a satisfied tone,
‘as if there were any difference between a planter and a
farmer except the spelling.’ Do you see any?</p>

<p class='c014'>“That night Fan and I quarrelled for the first time in
our lives. She said that I had no business to tell that she
was engaged and spoil her fun, and I said she had no business
to flirt so outrageously with everybody, and that if
she didn’t quit it I’d write to Jack. Then she began to
cry and wish she was dead. She didn’t see why when a
glimpse of the world was given her to enjoy she couldn’t
be allowed to enjoy it in her own way, and if she chose to
have a taste of the world, the flesh and the devil, meaning
the Colonel, she didn’t know why I should interfere.
She intended to marry Jack, but she meant to have a
good time first before settling down in dull old Lovering,
which she hated. Then her mood changed and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>acknowledged that she was wrong, and that night she wrote
Jack the longest letter she has written since we came here,
and the most loving, I dare say. The next day she was
as shy and demure as a nun, which sent the whole pack
after her fiercer than ever, but she cut them dead and
kept close to the Colonel as if for protection, and drove
with him to the lake and didn’t get back until ten o’clock.
She was gone with him again this afternoon, and the people
crowded on to the piazza to see them off in his stylish
turnout,—the finest here by far.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This letter troubled me greatly, and I wondered what
Jack would think of it. I remembered the long letter he
had received and how happy he had looked after it. I
had seen him reading it at least three different times, until
I felt sure he must know it by heart. After that her letters
were very short, both to him and to me. She had
not time to write much, she said, she was kept in such a
whirl, which grew dizzier as the season drew near its close.
She never mentioned the Colonel, or any other gentleman
in particular, but was loud in her praise of Katy, whose
flowerlike beauty, she said, had turned the heads of half
the men in Saratoga.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And her voice,” she wrote; “people rave about it as
if she were Patti herself. It seems the Diva sang here
once years ago, when she was about Katy’s age, and a
woman who heard her says she likes Katy’s voice better
and that she is far prettier, she is so fair and sweet and
unconscious of her great gift. I have let her sing twice
in public for some charities; they are always getting up
something of that sort and levying on any talent there
may be here. Prejudiced as I am against the stage I was
proud of Katy, she was so modest and unaffected, and
received the applause of the people so shyly and sweetly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Miss Errington has a plan in her mind for keeping Katy
in Washington and giving her lessons. She will probably
write you about it. I shall oppose it if there is a <em>career</em>
behind it. I have not yet reached a point where I want
my sister a public character, with her photographs in the
shop windows, and horrid wood-cuts of her in the papers.
I intend to have her at The Plateau a good deal of the
time to keep me from stagnating. Just think of it! Only
Jack and me, sitting there alone, admiring each other!
Well, nothing can blot out the remembrance of the good
time I am having now seeing the world, and there is so
much to see and enjoy, if one only had money.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hoped at one time Carl might join us. Katy has had
a few lines from him; did she tell you? He has gone with a
party to some outlandish place beyond the Rockies.
There are some people here from Boston who know him
well and speak highly of him. They say, however, that
he is a little too much inclined to forget the friends of
yesterday for those of to-day. We know that, don’t we?
An uncle on his father’s side has recently died and left
him what we should think a fortune. So he is richer now
than ever. I wish we had an uncle to die and leave us
some money. But, alas! if we ever had an uncle he was
dry as dust long ago.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Errington came in just here and proposed that,
instead of going back to Washington, we take a trip to
Quebec and Montreal and Chicago, returning by way of
the Falls and New York, where, she says, I can buy my
wedding trousseau. That last sounds fine, don’t it? I
wonder if she suspects how poor we really are and how
little there is for a trousseau. I don’t believe that, all
told, we can get together a hundred dollars without drawing
on the small sum we have in the bank in Richmond, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>selling Black Beauty. It may come to that yet. And
what do you think of the plan? Katy is crazy to go, and
I am just as anxious. I see no reason why we should not,
and I have virtually said we would, provided you do not
object too strenuously, and you are too unselfish an old
darling to do that. And so is Jack. How is the dear
boy? ‘Working like an ox to get the nest ready for his
bird,’ he wrote me. Oh, Jack, Jack! How good he is; far
too good for me! His letters always make me cry. I
feel my unworthiness so after reading them. I really
mean to settle down into the best and most domestic of
wives after I have seen the world.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A gentleman has sent up for me to drive with him, so
good-bye. We shall leave here within a week.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>FURNISHING THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>It was no use to protest against the journey which
would keep Fan and Katy from home four or five weeks
longer, and all Jack and I could do was to make the best
of it. Jack looked very sober when we talked it over
together.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am glad for her to enjoy herself and see the world,
as she calls it,” he said, smiling sadly; “but I miss her
so much. I am always wanting to ask her advice and know
if what I am doing suits her. You will have to take her
place in that respect.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was looking so tired and pale that night that even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Phyllis noticed it and asked, “What has done happened
to Mas’r Jack; he don’t look so peart-like as he did? Is
he frettin’ for Miss Fanny? She don’t or’to go to the
ends of the airth an’ her the same as merried. No man
would bar it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Phyllis and I were thrown so much together for companionship
that she usually told me what she thought.</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Pears mos’ like she was never comin’ back,” she said
more than once, and in spite of myself I was haunted by
a similar presentiment, which followed me everywhere,
and made me very kind and pitiful towards Jack.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was working very hard, and with his labor and
under his supervision the house was going up faster than
ever a house went up before in Lovering. The walls were
all enclosed and the rooms divided off according to the
plan, which Jack often brought to me, asking if I could
suggest any change. I could not. It was perfect as it
was. New houses were not common in Lovering. This
was the first since the war, and to me it seemed the quintessence
of all that was pretty and desirable. Nearly
every day all through September and on into October I
went with Paul to The Plateau to watch the work as it
progressed, and to please Jack, who said that he got on
better when I was there,—that I seemed a part of Fan
herself, and if he couldn’t have her I was next best.
This might be called a questionable compliment, but I
was grateful for crumbs. I doubt if Fan on her western
tour, which finally extended as far as Colorado and Salt
Lake City, was much happier than I was those long autumn
days, when I sat in a niche in the wall and watched
Jack busy with his men, of whom there were at least a
dozen, so anxious was he to surprise Fan when she came
home. How kind and attentive he was, coming often to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>me and trying to shield me from the sun if it were too
warm, or from the wind if it blew cold from the woods
or hills.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You don’t know what a comfort it is to have you
here,” he said to me one cool morning in October as he
sat down beside me, pulling my shawl over my shoulder
and unconsciously letting his hand rest there a moment
as a brother might have done. “I wish you were going
to live with Fanny and me. We need you to balance our
nervousness and excitement, you are so quiet and self-contained.
It will be a happy man who gets you,
Annie.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Jack,” was all I said, as I drew away from him
and turned my head that he might not see the waves of
crimson on my face, or hear the loud beating of my heart
as I could hear it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not for worlds would I have let him know that the girl
he thought so self-contained and quiet loved him with a
love far more enduring than any which Fan had ever
given to him. It was a sin, I knew, or soon would be,
and I fought against it with all my might, only to find it
growing stronger as the days went by and the time drew
near when he would be the husband of my sister. My
only resource when his spell was over me was to talk to
him of Fan,—where she was, what she was doing, what
she was seeing, and when she would be home. To all
this he responded readily, especially the coming home,
and how he meant to surprise her.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day in October when I went with Paul to The Plateau
he met me with a beaming face. Some land of his
near Richmond, which he had scarcely thought worth anything,
had been bought by a gentleman from the north,
who was going to put two or three houses upon it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“I feel rich,” he said,—“so rich that I am going to
commit the extravagance of buying lace curtains, the
real sort, not shams, a moquette carpet and upright
Steinway for the parlor. That will please Fanny. She
likes moquettes, they tread so softly, and I know she will
like a piano. I heard her say that no house was furnished
without one. Don’t you approve?” he continued, as I
did not answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>A moquette, at the prices they then brought with us,
was an extravagance, while the Steinway was a superfluity.
Fan had taken a few lessons and could play simple music.
But she didn’t care for it and seldom tried the superb
instrument which Mrs. Hathern had brought from Boston.
Under these circumstances it seemed to me that the
money he must pay for a Steinway could be better expended,
and I said so, giving as a reason that Fan was
not much of a musician.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, she is,” Jack answered quickly; “I’ve heard
her sing Bonny Doon when she actually brought tears,
I was so sorry for the chap who wrote it. Burns, wasn’t
it? That’s my favorite, words and all. And the way
Fanny sang it. I want to hear it again in this room;
and Dixie. How she can rattle that off; and Fisher’s
Hornpipe, and Money Musk. They are worth all the
classics in the world, and Bonny Doon is a hundred times
better than the hifalutin things you hear at concerts, when
the singer almost turns black in the face, and wiggles
and twists and stands on tiptoe as if she were going up
bodily with her voice, which, when it gets up as far as it
can go ends with a screech like she was in a fit. No,
sir! Give me the good, old-fashioned tunes such as Fan
can play.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Evidently Jack’s taste for music was not cultivated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>and I laughed merrily at his tirade against fashionable
singing, and then watched him as he drummed on the
window stool in imitation of playing a piano, and whistled
the air of Bonny Doon. I knew he would buy the moquette
and the Steinway, and said no more to discourage
him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now come up to <em>our</em> room,” he said, after he had
finished Bonny Doon and tried a few notes of Suwanee
River, another of his favorites.</p>

<p class='c014'>I followed him up to what was to be his sleeping-room,
and which he never entered without removing his hat as
reverently as if it had been a church. It was a sacred
place to him, and the one he meant to make the most
attractive in the house.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fanny will sit here a great deal,” he said, “because
the view is so fine, and then she can see me coming up
the hill on my way home. I know just how she will look
and can see her now, watching and waiting, and throwing
me kisses. What is that they sing in the prayer meetings?”
and he began to hum,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Will anyone then at the beautiful gate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be watching and waiting for me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>He was very musical that afternoon because he was so
happy, and Fan was very real to him watching by the
window as he came up the hill to what would be Paradise
because she was in it. Do the hearts of men like Jack
break more easily when betrayed? I do not know, but I
remember thinking that God would hardly forgive the
woman who played false to one who trusted her as Jack
trusted Fan.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She spoke of having this room all white and gold,”
he said, “and I am going to finish it up in white wood,
polished to look like marble with faint lines of gilt in it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>There’s a chamber set in Richmond, part willow work
and part white wood, with scrolls of gold here and there,
and on the headboard a medallion, with the figure of a
little girl in crimson cloak, with the hood brought over
her head and looking just as Fanny looked years ago
when a child and I drew her to school on my sled that
winter we had so much snow. The eyes of the girl in the
medallion smile at me just as Fanny’s did when I looked
back at her to see how she liked it. Don’t you remember?
You were there, too.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I did remember very well the day when Fanny had her
first sled ride, and in her new cloak, which was scarlet
instead of crimson, looked like a little queen as she sat
on the sled, while I trudged at her side in the snow, proud
of that privilege, and especially proud when, on going up
a hill which was nearly bare, Jack let me help him pull
her, and told me I made a very nice little filly. He had
asked Fan to get off in the steepest place, where the snow
had melted and made it muddy, and she had stormed and
kicked and said she wouldn’t, telling him he was her slave
and was to do her bidding. He had been her slave ever
since, and I had trudged beside them and was trudging still,
with, God knows, no envy or bitterness in my heart because
of the drudgery, or that Fan was always preferred
before me, but often with the thought of the joy it would
be to be loved by a man like Jack Fullerton.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I remember it,” I said, and he continued, “I
do want to buy that set, but if I get the moquette and
the Steinway it is beyond my pile at present, unless—”</p>

<p class='c014'>He stopped and his face beamed as with a sudden inspiration.
He had taken his watch from his pocket to
see what time it was, and was looking at it intently. It
was a stem-winder and very handsome, and Jack was very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>proud of it. I suspected what was in his mind, but said
nothing, lest I might be mistaken. As it was getting late
and growing rather cool I left him settling in his mind
where the different pieces of furniture would stand provided
he bought the coveted set. Outside in the yard I
found Paul, who had preferred to stay with the workmen
while I went through the rooms with Jack. In climbing
over the broken wall he had fallen upon his back or side
and was crying, saying it hurt him to walk. No bones
were broken, nor were any of his limbs sprained that I
could find, and after a while he signified his readiness
to go home, limping a little but utterly refusing the
poultice which Phyllis made that night and which was big
enough to encircle his entire body. The next morning
he seemed all right, except for an occasional halt in walking,
and I forgot the incident entirely in the greater interest
of house-furnishing.</p>

<p class='c014'>A week later Jack, who had been to Richmond, came
to me one night and told me the moquette and piano and
lace curtains and chamber set were bought and paid for,
and would be at The Plateau in a few days. Glancing at
his vest I saw that the gold chain was gone, and in its
place was a black ribbon, and then I knew what he had
done.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What time is it, please?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>Flushing and hesitating he finally drew out a plain silver
watch and held it up to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I’ve gone and done done it, as Phyllis would
say,” he said, laughingly. “I’ve sold my gold watch
and bought me a silver one, which keeps just as good
time. Fan always told me I was too fond of jewelry,—that
my big chain looked flashy. She’ll be pleased with
the black ribbon, and that child in the medallion is so like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>her. Seems as if she would speak to me and say ‘Get
up, old nigger,’ just as Fan did the day I drew her on my
sled.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no use in protesting, now that the deed was
done. So I said nothing, and after a moment Jack exclaimed,
as he put his hand in his pocket, “By Jove I
came near forgetting it; I have a letter for you, which I
found in the office as I came down. It is addressed in
Fanny’s handwriting and mailed in New York. They
are so far on their way home, and must be here soon. I
wonder she didn’t write to me, too. What does she say?
It’s a fat one, any way; there’s something in it from
Katy probably,” he continued, as he saw me take out a
note and glance at it before commencing to read the
letter.</p>

<p class='c014'>I knew it was not always safe to read Fan’s letters
aloud, and I ran my eyes hastily over this one, while Jack
waited impatiently. The travelers were in New York at
the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and Fanny was wild over what
she had seen and was seeing, especially on Broadway,
where she had done a little shopping.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Such lovely things,” she wrote, “but so expensive,
and my purse is so very small. Why, one suit, such as I
want, will take my entire fund. I have set my heart on
a cloth dress, tailor made, which is awfully stylish, and
will do to wear all winter, to mill and to meeting,—to call
in and to receptions,—only there will not be any in Lovering,
where the people have as much as they can do to
get enough to eat without throwing away their money on
frivolities. More’s the pity; and how stupid I shall find
it after seeing the world. Don’t be surprised if some
day, when you come up to The Plateau, you find me dangling
from a beam in the cellar. If so, put on my headstone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>‘Died of a broken neck, caused by <i><span lang="fr">ennui</span></i>.’ But
what nonsense. Let’s come to business, at once. I <em>must</em>
have more money, and this is what you are to do, ‘Sell
Black Beauty.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh,” I gasped, with a feeling similar to what I might
have felt if she had said “Sell Phyllis.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it? What’s the matter?” Jack asked, and
without stopping to think, I replied, “She wants to sell
Black Beauty to buy her a tailor-made gown.” “Sell
Black Beauty, her pony! Never!” Jack exclaimed, while
I read on:</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t ride him very often now, and when I am
married I shall have less use for him. He is getting old
any way, seventeen or eighteen, and eating his head off.
I am very fond of him, and there’s a big lump in my
throat when I think of parting with him, but that gown
is so ravishingly pretty and so becoming, and I want it so
much. Old Mrs. Arthur has asked me for Black Beauty
a number of times. He is just right to amble around the
neighborhood with her on his back or in the phaeton behind
him. She will take good care of him and pet him
more than I do. Go and see her, Annie, and if she’ll
give a hundred dollars,—that’s what she offered last summer,—take
it, and send at once before the gown is gone.
You don’t know how swell I feel driving to Arnold’s and
Stewart’s and Lord and Taylor’s in Miss Errington’s
handsome carriage, with two black men in livery, nor
how obsequious they are at these places to those who
come in carriages. Do you remember a copy which a
Yankee schoolmaster set for me years ago, and which we
thought so funny, ‘Money makes the mare go?’ It is
true, and the more money you have the faster the mare
goes. ‘Fan is an idiot!’ I think I hear you say. Perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>I am, but idiot or not, sell Black Beauty and send
me the money.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When am I coming home? I really don’t know for
sure. In time to be married, I suppose. Miss Errington
suggests that whatever dress-making I have to do be done
in Washington under her supervision and by her dressmaker,
who comes to the house. If I do this I shall, of
course, stay longer than I at first intended. Tell Jack not
to fret. He will have enough of me after we are married.
How is the house progressing? And how is Paul’s lameness?
Better, I hope. Miss Errington, to whom I read
your letter, made me very nervous by suggesting that his
fall might result in hip disease. That would be dreadful.
Paul a cripple! It can’t be; Miss Errington is always seeing
scare-crows. She is exceedingly kind, however, and
will send a note in this letter asking if she can keep Katy
during the winter and give her every advantage for musical
instruction. I have consented, and you may as well.
Katy will of course go home for Thanksgiving, and Miss
Errington has invited herself to accompany her,—or rather
us,—when we come.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did I tell you the Colonel was to sail for Europe the
3d of November in the Celtic? As she will wish to see him
off you may expect us the 25th,—three days before
Thanksgiving. That is Miss Errington’s plan. She just
came in to give me her note.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

      <div class='line'>“Lovingly,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>“<span class='sc'>Fan</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“P. S. I shall write Jack to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I read parts of this letter to Jack, skipping what I
thought he ought not to hear. He looked very grave
when I finished it, and said, “She is putting off her coming
as long as she can. It is three weeks to the 25th.
Does dress-making take so long?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>It took a good while, I told him, although Fan could
not have a great deal to do. Then I spoke of Black
Beauty, lamenting that he must be sold. We have had
him so long that he seemed like one of us, with human
instincts and affections.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Isn’t there some other way of getting that tailor
gown, if she must have it?” I said, looking up at Jack,
whose face wore an expression different from any I had
ever seen there.</p>

<p class='c014'>I thought he consigned the tailor-made gown to perdition,
but was not sure, he spoke so low. What I did
understand was that Black Beauty would not be sold
to Mrs. Arthur, and that I was to do nothing about it until
I saw him again. Then he went away, seeming a good
deal excited for Jack, and banged the door so hard behind
him that Paul, who had been sitting very quietly in
his high chair, asked “Is Jack mad?”</p>

<p class='c014'>This reminded me of what Fanny had said of possible
hip disease, and I remembered with a pang that Paul had
not played horse on father’s cane quite as much, or run
quite as fast since that fall on The Plateau. When I questioned
him, however, he said he had no pain except once
in a while when he was tired and then “something hurts
me here,” and he put his hand low down on his back.
I was not quite reassured, and determined to consult the
village doctor the next time I saw him. Then I read
Fan’s letter again, feeling as if an incubus had dropped
from me because the Colonel was going abroad. Fan had
never mentioned him before, but there had always been
in my mind an undefinable feeling of uneasiness as if he
were a dark shadow falling between her and Jack.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was two days before I saw the latter again and when
he came he was in a very different mood. He had received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Fan’s letter of four pages crossed and so full of
love and pretty sayings that if he could he would have
bought her ten tailor-made gowns.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was a brute the last time I was here,” he said, “I
was so disappointed that Fanny was not coming sooner.
Old Mrs. Arthur can’t have Black Beauty, for I’ve bought
him myself. I can’t part with him. I’ve had too many
plans of riding through the woods and around the country
with Fanny at my side. She never looks better than
when on Beauty’s back. Here is the money.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He held out a hundred dollar bill, which I was to send at
once and ask no questions as to where he got it. I think
he borrowed it and at first refused to take it, but he overruled
my objections, and that night it was on its way to
New York. Four days later an answer came to Jack and
to me. The gown was bought, and Jack was the dearest,
most indulgent fellow in the world, and she was beginning
to be very impatient to see him and all of us. They were
going to Washington the next day and in two weeks were
coming home. It was the nicest letter she had written in
some time, and Jack went off whistling to The Plateau,
where the house was nearly completed, so far as masons,
carpenters and painters were concerned. The plastering
was dry and the paint nearly so. Phyllis had cleared up
the rubbish, and cleaned the windows and floors, which
were ready for the carpets, which, with the furniture,
were standing about everywhere in boxes and bales.
Nearly all Lovering had been over the house, pronouncing
it perfect.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait till it is furnished and we give a house-warming;
then see what you think,” Jack said, as he piloted party
after party through all the rooms but the one which was
too sacred for common eyes to see and comment upon.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Our room,” where the bedstead with the medallion was
to be set up, and Fanny was to be waiting and watching
for him as he came over the hill.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE 25TH OF NOVEMBER.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>The beginning of the day was bright and fair, with no
cloud in the blue sky, and the warmth of the Indian summer
filled the hazy air. The close was dark and cold and
rainy, and left me a half-crazed woman, scarcely knowing
what I did or said, while Jack was as broken and blighted
as some tall tree which the storm has torn up by the roots
and cast helpless upon the ground. During the last two
weeks only short letters had come to Jack from Fanny,
while to me she had written at length, telling me how
glad she was at the prospect of coming home.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I reckon too much sight-seeing and dissipation have
made me nervous, or bilious, or both,” she wrote. “I
am not myself at all, either waking or sleeping. In fact
I don’t sleep. I, who used to drop off the moment my
head touched the pillow, now toss for hours without losing
consciousness, thinking—thinking—of everything, of
the past, the present, and the future, until my brain
seems actually broiling. Oh, the future! Don’t ever get
married, Annie. It’s dreadful,—not being quite certain
of anything except that you are not half good enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>for the man who loves and trusts you so fully. I wish
Jack were not so good. Wish he were more like me.
There would then be something like equality. But now,—Annie,
did you ever have a horrid nightmare in which
you were more awake than asleep, because you could see
and hear and feel, but had no power to move, although
you knew there was something creeping towards you
slowly, surely, with its arms stretched out to enfold you?
If you could cry out the spell would be broken, but you
can’t, and you lie there dead, as it were, waiting for the
end you cannot ward off. That is my condition, and will
be until I am under our Virginia skies and breathing Virginia
air at home with you.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We have fixed upon Monday the 25th for starting,
and as we do not reach Richmond until night you will not
see us until Tuesday morning. Shall I be awake then,
I wonder; or, will the creeping shadow have me in its
embrace? Pray for me, Annie. I need it more than
you know; why, I actually feel like asking Phyllis to <em>rassle
in prar</em> for me, I am in such a state. I wish we were coming
sooner, but Miss Errington wants to see her brother
off. You know he sails the 23d, and she is going to New
York with him on Friday. If I could, I’d start for Lovering
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was a part of Fan’s letter. The rest was full of
fun and jokes and anticipations of the Thanksgiving dinner
she was to eat at home, with some directions to Phyllis how
to cook it, and one or two allusions to “the house that
Jack built,” and which she knew she should like. She
closed with: “Your wretched sister, who knows how Paul
felt when he wrote to the Romans, chap. 7, verse 15,
‘What I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that do I.’
If as good a man as Paul whiffled round like that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>what can you expect of a weak, wicked girl like Fan
Hathern?”</p>

<p class='c014'>This letter troubled me a great deal at first. What did
it mean? What could it mean except that as the time
drew near Fan shrank from giving up her girlish life and
becoming the wife of Jack Fullerton. If this were so I
had no patience with her. After a little reflection, however,
I concluded that, as she had hinted, too much sight-seeing
and dissipation had unsettled her mind and liver,
making her both bilious and morbid. She would be all
right again when once in the quiet, healthful atmosphere
of home; and dismissing all anxiety from my mind, I began
to make preparations for the Thanksgiving dinner at
which Miss Errington and Jack were to be present. In
this Phyllis was quite as much interested as myself. For
weeks she had had a turkey fattening in a little pen, and
every time she fed it she informed it how many days more
it had to live before she cut off its head, and how many
hours it would probably take to roast it, information
which must have been very exhilarating to the bird, if it
could have understood it. After her fashion she had
cleaned the house, which, borrowing a term which she had
heard from Mrs. Hathern and Norah O’Rourke, was in
apple pie order. “Yankee apple pie, too,” she said,
when telling me how much soap and water she had used.
“I only give the kitchen a lick and a promise, as nobody
’ll meddle thar but myself,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>I expressed my approbation of the cleaning, although
I knew that in all human probability she had not raised a
window when she washed it, and that if Mrs. Hathern
could have walked in to investigate she would have found
the dust piled high on the top of the doors where Phyllis
had not thought to look. But Mrs. Hathern was where
neither moth nor rust corrupt, nor dust gathers on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>golden walls, and Phyllis was mistress of the kitchen.
The room which father had occupied had not been slept
in since he died, but we arranged it now for Jack, who
was to spend the night of Thanksgiving with us. Carl’s
room was to be given to Miss Errington, and both were
in readiness, as was everything else so far as I knew,
and I was looking forward anxiously to the coming Tuesday,
when our house would be filled with the sound of
laughter and happy voices.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had not been feeling very well and was, besides, so
busy with my own affairs that I had not been to The Plateau
for a week. I knew Jack was there early and late,
with men and women both, pushing matters as fast as
possible, and that some of the rooms were settled. Sunday
he was out of town, but Monday morning he came to
The Elms on his way to The Plateau, figuratively walking
upon air, he was so elated. I think I never saw a happier
light in any eyes than shone in Jack’s, or heard a more
joyful ring in any human voice than there was in his as
he bade me good morning, and added, “They will soon
be on their way. Hurrah!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Catching up Paul he swung him on his shoulder and
carried him two or three times across the wide hall.
Then, putting him down and rubbing his hands together,
he continued: “I tell you, Annie, the house is a daisy,
and so she will think. Four of the rooms are settled,—square
hall, dining-room, parlor and <em>our</em> room,—and I am
coming round in my buggy this afternoon to take you up
there. I’ve had fires in all the grates to dry out any
dampness, and everything is perfect. The bedrooms and
kitchen and such like are not settled, but they soon will
be. I have ordered a range just like yours and expect it
every day, and,—do you know <em>who</em> is to be the high cockolorum
in the kitchen?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>I could not guess, and he continued: “No darkies for
me, but the real article from Yankee land,—Miss Norah
O’Rourke! What do you think of that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Norah,” I exclaimed; “Norah!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, Norah,” he replied. “We have had quite a
brisk correspondence, Norah and I. She wrote me three
or four weeks ago, confidentially, saying Carl was tired
of keeping up his big establishment in Boston,—that he
was going to rent it and travel. That would throw her
out of a home. Next to Boston she liked The Elms, and
would come back, provided that <em>lazy, sozzlin’ nigger</em> wasn’t
here. I think that’s the way she put it. She couldn’t
abide the blacks, with their shiftlessness, she said, and it
wasn’t healthy to be with them. Her temper was never
the sweetest at its best, and they riled her so, slattin’
things round, and <em>het</em> her blood so hot that she was apt to
break out all over with a kind of rash. I am using her vernacular
as far as possible; but to come to the point. If
you hadn’t Phyllis and would dispose of any colored gentry
you might have and wanted her, she would come for a
price within your means. She could afford it, as she had
recently got a pension of eight dollars a month on account
of her brother Mike, who was killed at Gettysburg. I
don’t believe she was ever really dependent upon him for
support, and don’t quite understand how she got it.
Somebody did some tall swearing. But that’s not my matter.
If I were to swear a blue streak from here to Washington, I
couldn’t get a pension. Was on the wrong side of the fence.
But to proceed. If you had Phyllis, I was to say nothing.
If you hadn’t, I was to ask you if you wanted her. You had
Phyllis. I said nothing, but remembering to have heard
Fan say that she would give more for Norah’s little finger
than for Phyllis’s whole body, so far as order and neatness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>were concerned, I wrote to Norah, telling her my
prospects and asking her how she would like to live with
us. ‘Tip-top,’ she said, and she will be here within a
week,—go right into the house and have it all in readiness
from stem to stern by Christmas. For once I am in luck,
and Fan is coming to-morrow. Do you realize it? To-morrow
we shall see her. I can hardly wait. Be ready
this afternoon at two sharp. <i><span lang="fr">Au revoir.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c014'>As he went down the steps two at a time he was singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Never morning dawned so gaily,</div>
      <div class='line'>Never sky such radiance wore.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Alas, alas! I don’t know why I have written these two
words, and so anticipated the denouement. I should not
have done it had I not been nearing the almost tragedy
with which the day, which dawned so gaily, closed.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>AT THE PLATEAU.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>Precisely at two o’clock Jack was at the door, and a
few minutes after we were driving rapidly through the
town toward The Plateau. Jack had put on his best clothes,
as it was a half holiday with him, he said, and he looked
very handsome and animated as he talked constantly of
Fanny, recalling many incidents of her childhood, and
trying to decide just when he made up his mind that she
was the one girl in all the world for him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I reckon,” he said, “it was the first time I went off
to the war with my company, and she stood on the horse
block throwing kisses to us and waving a red shawl she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>had tied to a broom handle. Most of the boys were in
love with her, and I think it was her fierce patriotism
which kept our courage up, when it might otherwise have
cooled. I remember once when we were waiting for a
battle to begin, a comrade who stood beside me said,
‘What are you thinking of, Jack?’ I <em>was</em> thinking of
Fan, but I replied, ‘Nothing; what are you thinking of?’
‘Nothing,’ was his answer. Just then there came the
opening roar of cannon, with the order for our company
to move on. Simultaneously we both shouted, ‘Hurrah
for the South, and Fanny Hathern.’ The comrade was
poor Tom Allen, who was killed in that battle, and Fan’s
name was the last upon his lips. I never told her, and
never shall. I don’t think she cared for him, and I have
sometimes been afraid she did not care for me as I do for
her. But she will. I shall be so kind to her and try to
make her so happy that she must love me after awhile, if
she does not at first. I am a sort of country clown, I
suppose, and not at all like the high-toned chaps she has
been consorting with; but I do believe my heart is in the
right place,—that is, my intentions are good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was silent a moment,—then turning towards me
he continued: “You know the best and the worst of me,
if anybody does, and I feel like making you a kind of
confessor, or rather confidant, as to how I feel and what I
mean to do. Shall I, Annie-mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>This name by which Paul called me Jack had taken up
since he had been so much at The Elms, saying it suited
me, I was such a motherly little woman, with a manner
which made everyone confide in and trust me. I liked
the name as used by Paul, to whom I was a kind of mother,
but I did not quite like to have Jack call me thus. It
made me feel so much older than I really was,—older
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>than he, and a great deal older than Fan, who, Phyllis
said, was really my senior by half an hour. I had never
given any sign that it was distasteful to me, nor did I
now. I merely said, “I am sure you have nothing to
confess.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, not exactly that. It is more a confidence as
to what I mean to do,” he said. “I am all strung up to
a pitch of nervousness or exhilaration, and must talk to
somebody. This morning when I woke up, and the sun
was just rising over the woods, and I felt so light and airy,
I asked myself what it was? What had happened, or what
was going to happen? Then I remembered that Fanny
was coming to-morrow, and that in just a month she
would be my wife. I was so thankful and happy that
I wanted to do something. You know I’m not very
religious, like you and Fan, and I’m not a praying man.
I say the prayers in church with the rest of the people,
but half the time I’m thinking of something else, and
once in a while I go to sleep during the Litany. But
I am going to turn over a new leaf, and this morning I
went down on my knees and thanked God for Fanny, and
asked that I might make her happy, and that she might
come safely home to me, and I promised to be a better
man and join the church and have family prayers just as
your father did, and ask a blessing at the table as mother
did. Fanny will like that, I am sure. You don’t know
how peaceful and quiet I felt after that. Why, it seemed
as if I really had been talking to some one who heard and
answered me, and the future looks so bright that if I were
in one of Phyllis’s <em>pra’r</em> meetings I believe I should shout.
I can readily understand how she works herself up to having
the power. I could have it in a little while.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We were going up the hill to The Plateau by this time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>and in Jack’s face there was the rapt expression of one
who had talked with God as friend talks with friend, and
been made the better for it. The sky, which in the morning
had been so clear, had gradually been growing grey
and overcast, until the sun was hidden from view, and in
the west a bank of clouds was rising rapidly and threatening
rain. It was growing chilly, too, and as a cold breeze
came down the hill, Jack urged his horse on until we came
upon the house which looked so pretty and attractive,
with all the debris cleared away and the grounds brought
up somewhat to their former condition when it was the
show place of the town.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Isn’t it lovely?” Jack said, helping me to alight, and
then marching me round to look at a view we had both
seen a thousand times, but which was always new to him
because Fanny’s eyes were to see it daily.</p>

<p class='c014'>He pointed out the tops of the Blue Ridge in the distance,
the valley through which the river ran, and the
opening in the woods through which the first Federal soldiers
who appeared in our midst came marching, years
ago, throwing our little town into wild excitement and
alarm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I heard you were so frightened that you ran to the
attic and hid behind the chimney, while Fan armed herself
with the poker and went into the street ready to fight, if
necessary,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>He frequently made comparisons between Fan and myself,
and usually to my disadvantage. But I did not care,
and now I laughed merrily as I recalled the day when I
first heard the Yankees were coming and crawled behind
the chimney, half expecting to be shot. I had not then
learned that there was very little difference between the
conduct of the Yankees and the rebels, and not much to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>be feared from either. After the view was exhausted I
was taken to see the bit of sodding which had been done
where the ground was torn up,—the shrubs which had
been planted and the flower beds which had been marked
out ready for spring. Noticing at last that I shivered as
a gust of wind, damp with coming rain, swept across The
Plateau, Jack said, “Why, you are cold, aren’t you? I do
believe it’s going to rain right away. Go into the house
where there is a fire. I will be there in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He went whistling to the stable with his horse, while
I made my way alone into the house. Passing through
the kitchen I came first to the dining-room, with its crimson
carpet and curtains, its polished oak table and carved
chairs of the same wood, upholstered in dark-green leather,—its
handsome sideboard standing in the niche made for
it,—its china and glass and fancy cups hanging on hooks,—a
fashion beginning to prevail at the north and which Jack
had seen in Richmond. There was no grate in this room,
but a deep fireplace, ornamented with the brass andirons
and fender which had belonged to Jack’s mother. On
the hearth some pine knots were laid ready for a fire on
the morrow, when the real mistress came to see her new
home. On one side of the room was a pretty conservatory
half full of plants with a hanging basket before two
of the windows. Fanny was fond of flowers and Jack had
remembered everything.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, what do you think of it? Have I been too extravagant
to suit my little economical Annie-mother?” he
said, coming in just as I had finished inspecting the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>I told him it was lovely, but said nothing about extravagance,
although I did wonder where all the money came
from. I kept on wondering as I went from room to room,
stopping next in the square hall with its broad landing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>in an angle of which the tall clock was ticking, with a
stained glass window on one side of it and Mrs. Fullerton’s
portrait on the other. The polished floor in this
room was bare with the exception of a few rugs here and
there. The deep window seats were cushioned, and a
bright fire was burning in the grate. This had been my
favorite room from the first, it was so unlike in its construction
any room I had then seen, and I was disposed
to linger there in the easy chair before the warm fire.
But Jack hurried me on to the parlor,—<em>the great room</em> he
laughingly called it, as he threw open the door. The
moquette carpet was down and so thick and soft that my
feet nearly went out of sight as I trod upon it. Nothing
could have been in better taste than the whole arrangement
of the room, from the lace draperies at the windows
to the Steinway in the corner. I had not seen it
since it was unpacked, and anxious to hear its tone I stepped
up to open it when Jack laid his hand on my shoulder
and said, “Excuse me, please, but it is a fad of mine
that Fanny’s fingers must be the first to touch the keys.
I’ve had it tuned and know it is in good shape, and to-morrow
afternoon, when I bring Fanny up here, I am going
to have her sing and play Home, Sweet Home, and
Bonny Doon, and then, little woman, you may drum away
on it all you please. Of course the room is not quite finished.
It looks a little stiff yet,” he continued, glancing
around. “It wants some jim-cracks and things, which
Fanny will see to. An old shawl of hers, thrown on the
back of a chair will change it wonderfully. By George, it
begins to rain. I didn’t think it would come so soon. I
am glad I put Robin in the stable,” he exclaimed, as a
few drops pattered against the windows, “Let’s go now
to our room.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>This I knew was the <i><span lang="fr">pièce de résistance</span></i>, the grand reserve
kept for the last, and it seemed to me as I followed Jack
up the stairs as if he stepped softly, reverently, as we go
to look at the dead. But it was not much like a death
chamber,—that bright room, with its wide bay window,
from which fluted muslin curtains were artistically draped
back so as not to obstruct the view. By the centre window
a pretty work-table stood, with an inlaid work-box on
the top ready for use. On one side of the table a large
easy chair, with head and foot rest. On the other side
a low rocker, where Fan was to sit and watch for Jack,
and later on sew and listen while, in the chair opposite,
he talked or read to her, or smoked a little, if she would
let him, and he reckoned she would. All this he explained
to me, making me try first Fanny’s chair to get the view
on one side; then his to get the view on the other side,
and then calling my attention to the carpet, a light,
pretty ingrain, with a delicate pattern of roses.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wanted to get Brussels,” he said, “but couldn’t
quite afford it yet. We can put down some matting in
the summer. Mrs. Maney of Richmond says that is the
correct thing. She helped me a lot. Couldn’t have got
along without her. What do you think of the furniture?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I said it was prettier than anything I had ever seen, especially
the bedstead, with the medallion and the young
girl in the crimson cloak and hood, looking at me with
Fanny’s eyes and Fanny’s smile as I remembered it when
she was a child.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is very much like Fanny, and looks as if it could
speak to us,” I said, and Jack, who was regarding it with
all his heart in his eyes replied, “She <em>is</em> speaking to me,
and saying, ‘I am coming. I shall be with you to-morrow,’
God bless her.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>He was almost childish in his happiness, and more like
an expectant boy than a man, and I am glad to remember
that for a brief space of time he was as perfectly happy
as it is often given us to be; glad, too, that in that supreme
moment, when all his mighty love was showing in
his face and voice, I had no pang of regret or pain because
it was another and not myself to whom his love
was given. Was there, I wonder, no influence emanating
from that room strong enough to reach the girl of
whom we both were thinking so intently, and tell her that
this was <em>her hour</em>,—the last in which she would ever be
loved by a man as good and true as Jack Fullerton?</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment we stood looking at the picture, and
then Jack, who had spied a bit of dust on a table, took
his handkerchief from his pocket to wipe it off. In doing
so his hand came in contact with a letter for me which
he had found in the office and forgotten until this moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know why I was so stupid. If it had been
from Fanny I should have remembered it, but it is from
New York,” he said, as he handed me the rather bulky
letter, which was postmarked New York and directed in
a handwriting I did not at first recognize.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who is writing me from New York?” I said, examining
the writing minutely, with a feeling that I had seen
it before. Suddenly it came to me, and I exclaimed
“Col. Errington. He was to sail Saturday and this is
mailed Saturday. What can he have written to me, and
so much, too?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Just then word came up that the new range had arrived,
and Mr. Fullerton was wanted to superintend the placing
it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right,” he said. “I’ll be there directly;” then
to me, “you will excuse me a moment.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Then he was gone, and I sat looking at the letter and
hesitating to break the seal.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE LETTER.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>There certainly are times in one’s life when there comes
a presentiment of impending evil, and such a time was
that when something told me that the reading of the letter
in my lap would not leave me just as it found me. But
there was no thought of Fanny in my mind until I opened
it, and saw that it contained a note directed to Jack in
her handwriting, a little unsteady and crooked, but unmistakably
hers. There was a trembling in my hands, a
weakness in my wrists and back, and I felt my eyes growing
hot and dim, as, putting the note on the table, I resolutely
turned to the beginning of the letter and read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Washington, November 21st, 18—.</span> Thursday</div>
      <div class='line'>Evening, after 11 o’clock, with my</div>
      <div class='line'>trunk packed for the journey, and everybody</div>
      <div class='line'>in the house asleep but myself, who</div>
      <div class='line'>feel as if I should never sleep again.</div>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Annie</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I am writing to you for the last time as Fanny Hathern.
When this reaches you I shall be on the sea,—going
to Europe with Col. Errington as his wife!”</p>

<p class='c014'>If some one had written to me that Fanny was dead,
the shock would not have been so great, although different.
Consciousness did not forsake me, but for a brief
space hearing and seeing did, except that rings of fire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>danced before my eyes, and in my ears there was a roaring,
far-off noise, as if some one were repeating over and
over again “with Col. Errington as his wife.” I have
been told that when one is near drowning, all the incidents
of his life are unrolled before him. I was neither
drowning, nor dying, but I seemed to see at a glance all
Fan’s past as connected with Jack, and her present as
connected with Col. Errington, and I scarcely needed to
read her letter to know how it had happened. When sight
and sound came back, I was conscious of a feeling of intense
heat as if I was smothering. I must have air, and
dragging myself to the window I opened it, and with the
rain beating upon me, although I did not feel it, I read
the letter through. It was written half in badinage, half
in extenuation, and had in it a ring of pain which told me
that there was enough of the old Fan left to torture the
new one with remorse when she had time to realize what
she had done, and to learn the difference between a heart
which beat for her alone, and one which cared for her
only as she ministered to its selfishness and pride.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t condemn me utterly,” she wrote, “until you
read my letter and know how it has come about, if indeed
I can tell you. I believe it has been coming ever since
that day when Col. Errington came to The Elms with his
sister and found us picking grapes. He says it began
when he raided our house with his troops and I talked so
saucily to him. I could have killed him then in my hatred
of everything wearing the Federal uniform. I have at
times almost wished I had done so, when I have felt his
meshes closing round me until I had no power to resist.
Do you remember the old geography we studied years
ago, when Mr. Allen from the north was our teacher?
There was in it a picture of the so-called Maelstrom on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>the coast of Norway, with a ship which had got into
the whirl going down, the faces and hands of the ill-fated
passengers upturned and imploring help, which could not
reach them. That picture had a great fascination for me,
especially after Mr. Allen explained it to us so vividly that
I felt my hair prickle at the roots, and could see it all so
distinctly. The pleasure boat full of giddy young people
skirting around the edge of the whirlpool into whose circle
they were being gradually drawn;—sailing pleasantly and
smoothly round and round, each time swifter than before
until at last the line was crossed over which there was no
return. Human skill was of no avail. Human aid could
not reach them, and they were drawn on and on, nearer
and nearer to the roaring mass of angry waters into which
they entered at last and went down to the depths below,
where, according to his statement the sea floor is strewed
with the wrecks of boats and white with human bones.
This picture was bad enough, but it was worse still when
he drew a moral lesson from it and told us how our little
faults, if not overcome would grow until we could not
control them and they would drag us on to the great
Maelstrom of sin into which we would plunge, head first,
I think he said, and go <em>down</em>, <em>down</em>, <em>down</em>,—not to the
bottom of the sea,—but to <em>hell</em>,—and he emphasized
the last word with a blow on the table with his big ruler
which made me nearly jump out of my skin. I was
scared almost to death, and began to think of all the
bad things I had done, putting beech nuts in Charlie’s
bed, and a little mud-turtle in the pocket of Phyllis’s
Sunday gown, calling you a fool, and spitting at Jack,
when he tried to kiss me. I could not sleep for thinking
about it, and finally made Phyllis my confessor and told
her of my fear of the Maelstrom of sin.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“‘Laws, honey,’ she said, stroking my hair, ‘don’t you
worry. What’s you got to do any way with Moll Stroon’s
sin? Let her take keer of it herself. You’se nothin’ to
do with it. What was it any way? And who was Moll
Stroon?’</p>

<p class='c014'>“I laughed till I cried at her mistake, and called her
an old idiot, and didn’t worry any more about Moll
Stroon’s sin. I have since read that the Maelstrom, as
we regarded it, is a myth, or at the most a very narrow
strait on the coast of Norway through which the sea
pours rapidly four times a day with the ebb and flow of
the tide,—that when it meets a strong wind from the
opposite direction, the water bubbles and boils and seethes
like a cauldron, but nothing is ever drawn into it except
foolish whales who are too big to turn round and go back.
Why have I dwelt so long on this Maelstrom? I don’t
know, unless it is to show you how, ever since I left home,
I have been hanging on the verge of a moral whirlpool,
sliding over one circular wave after another until I grew
dizzy and have finally tumbled in. To use a slang phrase,
‘that is about the size of it.’ Col. Errington says that
he never forgot me for a day after the first time he saw
me, and I stood up so bravely and told him what I thought
of him; that when he saw me the second time on the ladder
with grape stains on my face and I as unconcerned
about my personal appearance as if I had been a queen
and he my subject, he registered a vow that if possible
he would make me his wife. You know he did write,
offering me his hand. I never answered his letter, and
that cooled his ardor, until he came the third time and
found us at The Plateau. The knowledge that I was engaged
to Jack dampened him a little, but he did not despair,
and when he succeeded in getting me to Washington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and under his influence he felt tolerably sure of success,
seeing as he did how fond I was of everything which
riches can give. He has never said a word against Jack.
That would have defeated his plan, but in a thousand
ways I cannot describe he has made me feel how wholly
unfitted I am to be the wife of a poor man, and how eminently
fitted to shine in a society different from anything
in Lovering. He has made me feel, too, that Jack is
countrified and that after a while I should grow away from
him and perhaps be ashamed of him,—a state of things
which would make me wretched. I know there is more
real goodness in Jack’s little finger than in the Colonel’s
whole body and told him so. He only laughed and said
he had no doubt of it, but he believed I would be happier
with his whole body bad as it was than with Jack’s
good little finger. If he has never said anything derogatory
of Jack he has of Lovering, which seen with his
eyes and my recent experience of something better
seems to me the dullest place on earth, and one in
which I couldn’t possibly live again. You don’t know
anything about it Annie; you who have never been
anywhere except to Boston. Then it was a funeral at
which you could not be very gay. You only saw the
usual sights of the city with Carl. You know nothing of
grand hotels, with suites of rooms and obsequious waiters,
who come at your nod, because you belong to the Errington
party,—of fine turnouts with coachmen and footmen
in livery, and people looking admiringly after you;—of
elegant houses, such as there are in New York and Washington,
and especially Col. Errington’s, where everything
is the most expensive kind, with hosts of servants to do
your bidding;—of splendid dresses and jewels such as
ladies wear to dinners and receptions; boxes at the opera,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>and all the pleasant gossip, a knowledge of these things
brings to those who are in the swim. This is society,
and I like it and it has been offered me a good many times
in return for myself, and a good many times I have refused
it, but when I thought the matter settled the
Colonel has changed his base of operations and commenced
the siege again. His love-making has never been
open and impetuous like Jack’s, but done persistently and
in that delicate, persuasive way so hard to resist. Neither
Miss Errington nor Katy have a suspicion of it. Indeed,
his sister expects to go with him to New York to-morrow
and see him off on Saturday, and she has asked Katy and
me to accompany her. I declined, but I believe Katy
intends to go. I hardly think she will, and I dread the
scene in the morning when they must know the truth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I did not decide until this afternoon. I drove with
the Colonel this morning far out into the country. We
were gone two or three hours, and he improved his opportunity,
urging every possible reason why I should not
marry Jack and should marry him. In Lovering I would
be a nonentity, darning my husband’s socks and looking
after the kitchen to see things were not wasted. In
Washington I would be a leader in society, quoted and
admired, with every wish gratified, and the finest establishment
in the city. He would build a house for me, he
said, much handsomer than the one he now occupies, and
he took me around to see the site on one of the pleasantest
and most fashionable avenues. He would have two or
three plans sent to us for approval in Europe, and it could
be commenced at once. As soon as we had the measurements
of the rooms I could, if I liked, order the carpets
and rugs, together with the furniture. There were to be
draperies from Paris, pictures and statuary from Rome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>and Florence, china and linen from Dresden and England,
and bric-a-brac from everywhere. There was to be a
cottage at Newport in the summer,—trips to Florida in the
winter, where, if I liked, he would build a pretty villa near
some one of the many lakes which abound in the southern
part of the state. He knows a spot which will just
suit me in Orange County. I think it was this villa, which
he described so vividly, with its broad piazza,—vine
covered and cool,—its palms and magnolias and orange
trees and roses, and fanciful rowboat on the lake, which
moved me the most. I can have you and Paul there.
The place will suit you better than the gayeties of Washington,
or Newport, and in imagination I have already
filled the wide piazza of Palmetto Villa with chairs and
stools, and a little round table for books or work, or afternoon
tea, and I have put Paul into a hammock and you
into an easy chair, and have with you looked across the
road to Lake Hathern sparkling in the sunlight, and have
inhaled the perfume of orange blossoms and the delicious
Florida air, freighted with the odor of many flowers.
And by and by carriages come out from Orlando, a pretty
town close by, with people to call upon us, English and
Americans, and our grounds are bright with the flutter
of gay dresses, and the house is filled with the chatter of
small talk,—admiration of the place, and implied compliments
of the beautiful hostess,—that is I, who carries herself
like a duchess, and says to herself, ‘This is life; I
did well not to refuse it.’ Isn’t that a charming picture?
I thought so and began to waver.</p>

<p class='c014'>“On our return to the house the Colonel found a telegram
from the White Star office, asking if he still wished
them to reserve the staterooms he had looked at when in
the city last week. If so, he must let them know at once,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>as another party wanted them. He had been so sure
that I would go with him, he said, that he had partially
engaged the rooms, and now I must decide.</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Give me an hour,’ I said, and after my lunch I went
directly to my room, pleading a headache, which would
keep me from going out with Miss Errington and Katy,
who were to make some purchases for Lovering. I locked
the door, took off my dress, put on a wrapper, let down my
hair, unbuttoned my boots, looked in the glass, and then
sat down to weigh the pro’s and con’s of the situation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you remember that queer little thing which I once
recited at school, ‘The Philosopher’s Scales,’ which were
not made to weigh sugar and tea, but qualities, feelings,
thoughts and sense. The first thing he tried, we are told,
was the head of Voltaire pitted against the prayer of the
penitent thief, with the result that the head flew up and
the prayer down. Then</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A lord and a lady went up at full sail,</div>
      <div class='line'>When a bee chanced to light in the opposite scale.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Then at last,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The whole world was bowled in at the grate,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the soul of a beggar to serve for a weight,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the scale with the soul in’t so mightily fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>That it jerked the philosopher out of his cell!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“All this recurred to me so vividly this afternoon and
keeps repeating itself over and over in my brain as I sit
writing this to you. I am a little girl again in the old
school-house at Lovering. It is Wednesday afternoon,
and outside under the trees several horses are tied, with
here and there a negro in attendance. Inside, the western
sun comes through the windows and lies in great
splashes of light on the floor. On his little perch of a
platform Mr. Allen, of Maelstrom notoriety, sits calling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>the names of those who are to recite or declaim, his voice
sounding like thunder when he says ‘Fanny Hathern:
The Philosopher’s Scales.’ In her red merino gown and
white apron <em>Fanny Hathern</em> walks from her seat to the
platform, the distance seeming a mile, and her heart
thumping like a trip-hammer, as she tries to remember
whether it was the <em>prayer</em> of Voltaire and the <em>skull</em> of the
thief, or <em>vice versa</em>. There is company in school that afternoon,
the Trustees, of whom the girl’s father is one,
and hence her anxiety to acquit herself creditably with
her scales. You are there and Charlie, and Jack is in the
corner just where the little girl can see him, as she curtsies
straight down and begins, with her eyes fixed on
him, for she knows his lips will try to form the words if
she wavers. He has helped her learn the piece and heard
her rehearse it many times, telling her how to manage her
voice, for Jack is a natural orator. The little girl acquits
herself very creditably and goes back to her seat, passing
so near to Jack that she hears distinctly his whispered
words, ‘You did it tip-top.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear old Jack, who always thought I did everything
‘tip-top,’ and who brought me the biggest apples he could
find in the bin, who put so many sugar hearts and raisins
into my desk, and carried me in his arms across the puddles
of water, when I was afraid of spoiling my new
shoes. What will he think of me now, I wonder? Believe
me, Annie, my face is wet with tears as I recall those
far-off days and think of Jack, who would never serve me
as I am serving him. It is raining heavily to-night and
the wind howls at my window with a sound in it like a
human sob or moan,—like Jack’s voice calling to me
through the storm, and saying it is not too late to draw
back. There it comes again, the moan,—making me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>creep all over, there is something so uncanny in the
sound at this hour of the night. It is <em>not</em> too late to draw
back, and I’ll do it, too. If the Colonel is still up,—if
there is a light over or under his door, I will knock and
tell him I have changed my mind, that I cannot break
Jack’s heart—I have been out into the hall and the
whole length of it, treading very cautiously lest Miss
Errington or Katy should hear me. There was no light
over or under the Colonel’s door. He was fast asleep,
snoring horribly at intervals, and it was these snores
which I mistook for Jack’s moaning in the wind. I cannot
draw back. It is too late. I believe I am half crazed
and don’t know what I am writing, or have written. I
remember I had reached the ‘Philosopher’s Scales’ when
I digressed so widely, so I will return to that point and
the time this afternoon when I sat down to weigh the
pro’s and con’s,—the <em>pro’s</em> for my marrying the Colonel,
and the <em>con’s</em> against it. Into the <em>con</em> I put Jack, young,
handsome, true as steel, good every way, with no fault
whatever except that he is poor, knows but little of fashionable
society and cares less, wears old-fashioned coats
and slouch hats, with his trousers in his boots when the
roads are muddy. That was Jack, and of course the <em>con</em>
went down with a whack as there was nothing to balance
it. Then I took the Colonel, years older than I am, growing
bald on the top of his head and a little deaf in one ear,
with some grey in his hair and whiskers, and no power to
thrill or quicken my pulse when he touches my hand, as
Jack has. Good habits, distinguished looking, remarkably
well preserved, polished manners, perfect knowledge
of the world and every shade of etiquette, and always
habited in the last style from his collar to his boots.
That was the Colonel, and I put him into the <em>pro</em> scale,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>which was up in the air and swung and teetered, but did
not make Jack, who was down, budge an inch. The <em>con</em>
was ahead, and I was glad, but I meant to be fair, and
took up Lovering next, asking what besides Jack and you
and Paul it had to offer me in exchange for the
world of society I liked so much. Two or three picnics
in the summer when the people eat their lunch on the
ground in the woods, with bugs and ants crawling over
them, and pretend they like it. A few tea parties, where
the talk is mostly of the good times before the war and
the bad times since. Possibly a circus. (By the way,
I hear Buffalo Bill is going to Richmond next spring. If
he does, sell your best bonnet and go and see him and
take Paul.) So much for summer dissipation. In the
winter it is a little better. A singing school, amateur
theatricals for the churches, or Y. M. C. A.’s, or W. C.
T. U.’s, of which half the people approve and the other
half disapprove. Occasionally a lecture and concert and
travelling play actors, who are second class, or they would
not come to Lovering. The negro revival, which is lively,
and the Sewing Society or Guild once a month, with tea,
one kind of cake, no napkins, and gossip. As Mrs. Jack
Fullerton I might in time become President of the Guild
and walk miles to find a place for it to meet; that would
perhaps be some compensation for the dullness of the
place, and relieve the ennui of living alone at The Plateau,
with you at the other end of the town. Think how
bored I should be after the novelty of counting my silver
and dishes had worn off. There would be nothing left
me to do but to hob-a-nob with the cook and watch
for Jack, who would in time be as bored as I. That is
Lovering life and I put it in the scale with Jack, expecting
that, like the lord and the lady, he would go up at full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>sail. He only stirred a very little and looked at me so
steadfastly with his honest, trusting eyes, that I still
hoped he would win.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must, however, be fair to the Colonel, and I piled on
top of him the trip to Europe, jewels and dresses and
travel and a French maid. The new house and grounds in
Washington, the cottage at Newport, Palmetto Villa in
Florida, a box at the opera, horses and carriages, and all
the money I want to spend, with nothing to do except to
enjoy it. This settled the matter and the <em>pro’s</em> went down
so fast and the <em>con</em> went up so swiftly, that Jack and Lovering
were thrown out and vanished entirely. The die was
cast, and without a moment’s hesitation I made myself presentable
and went to the library, where I found the Colonel,
calm and cool and polishing his thumb nail with one of
those little brushes which come for that purpose: He has
a full set. Rather effeminate, I think. I did not stop a
minute lest my courage should fail, for something was
tugging at my heart, which felt like a lump of ice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘I am going with you to Europe,’ I said, the words
half choking me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He stopped polishing his thumb nail, and drawing
me to him——Well, no matter what he did, except that it
was all very dignified and circumspect, and not at all like
Jack, who nearly ate me up when I promised to marry
him. Poor Jack! I have said that to myself many times
since my interview with the Colonel, which did not last
long. I was in a hurry to get away from him, his hands
were so cold and clammy, not at all like Jack’s. But
then he is a man of an entirely different temperament,
and may be just as kind. He was very glad for my decision,
he said, and he trusted I would never regret it; he
should certainly try to make me happy. I didn’t tell him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>I was regretting it even then. Disengaging myself from
him I went to my room and cried as if my heart would
break. I heard him go out and knew that in a few moments
there would flash across the electric wires to the
White Star office in New York the message ‘Keep the
staterooms, Nos. —— and —— for me. G. Errington.’ The
deed was done, and when about five o’clock Miss Errington
and Katy came in from their shopping I was lying on the
couch in my room with a headache which was not feigned.
Katy was full of purchases made for you and Paul and
Phyllis and Jack, while Miss Errington had been busy
collecting a few things for her brother’s comfort on the
sea. You know she was intending to go with him to New
York and take Katy with her, and my conscience smote
me as I heard her talking about it and planning that I
should not be lonely during her absence. The Colonel
told me to have my trunk packed to-night, taking as little
as possible. I was to say nothing to anyone, but leave
it for him to tell his sister in the morning before I came
down to breakfast. Ah me, how I dread the scorn in her
eyes and the surprise in Katy’s when they know all. Miss
Errington is a splendid woman; rather peculiar in some
respects and nearly as determined as her brother when
once her mind is made up. She has been most kind and
generous to me and seems to like me very much. But
Katy is her favorite. She has spoken of taking her
abroad. If she is still of this mind, don’t oppose it, although
it will leave you very lonely. Let Katy see the
world. She is exceedingly beautiful, with a face and
voice like an angel. She ought to make a brilliant match,
and with Miss Errington to chaperone her, I think she
will, and forget her foolishness about the stage. There
is no one in Lovering for her, but with Miss Errington her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>chances are many. I suspect she has a fancy for Carl,
but that will never amount to anything. He scatters too
much. I hear of him here and there and everywhere,
sipping sweets from many flowers and caring particularly
for none.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is one o’clock in the morning. I have still my note
to write to Jack, a harder task than writing to you, so I
will leave this letter and finish it in New York after the
deed is done and I can tell you of the manner with which
the news was received by Miss Errington and Katy.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have on my traveling gown and jacket,—the tailor-made
one, which is very becoming, with gilt buttons and
braid. On the table is a fur lined cloak, with shawls and
wraps enough to have warmed even Harry Gill, if anything
could have thawed that chattering wretch. I feel
some like him, for my hands and feet are icy cold. But
I must finish my letter commenced in Washington and
tell you of the row we had when it was known that I was
to marry the Colonel. He told his sister in the library
before breakfast, when she came in ready for the journey
she expected to take. At first she refused to believe it,
and I was sent for to confirm the news. I went with my
knees shaking under me and in a condition more like
Harry Gill than ever. She was white to her lips, and her
eyes burned like coals of fire as she demanded if what she
had heard was true.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘Answer her, Fanny. She does not believe me,’ the
Colonel said.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I was never afraid to speak before, but something in
Miss Errington’s manner and attitude cowed me completely
and I hesitated before stammering out that it was
true, and I was going to marry her brother.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘If you will excuse me I will leave you to settle it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>between yourselves, as I have something to see to. But
don’t be long, there is not much time to lose,’ the Colonel
said, in his usual suave manner.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bowing politely he disappeared, while his sister stood
clutching the back of a chair, tall and erect and confronting
me like some dreadful Nemesis. I knew I deserved
the worst that she could say or think of me, and cowered
before her while she regarded me with unutterable disdain.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘Miss Hathern,’ she began, ‘If there were no reason
why it should not be, I might be glad to receive you as
my brother’s wife, but to break your engagement with
another man so suddenly is monstrous. Have you weighed
the subject well?’</p>

<p class='c016'>“I thought of the Scales, but knew she would not understand
that, or the Maelstrom either. She was matter
of fact and I must answer her in the same spirit. As well
as I could I tried to explain till she had a tolerably fair
insight as to the real motives which actuated me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘I see,’ she said, sarcastically. ‘Because the man is
poor you are throwing him over and selling yourself for
money and freedom. I pity you when you waken to know
what you have done. My brother is dear to me, of course,
but I know him, and he will not be a pleasant man for a
woman of your spirit to live with. Everything in his
power must bend to his will or break. He may not beat
you, although he does his horses and dogs, when they
disobey, but he will bend you until you have no free will
of your own, and the time will come when you will long
with inexpressible longing for the love and tenderness and
consideration of the man you are discarding.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“At this moment Katy came rushing in. She had
heard the news from the Colonel, and throwing her arms
around my neck sobbed hysterically, begging me to give
it up for all our sakes,—Jack’s, your’s, Paul’s, Phyllis’s,
father’s and Charlie’s, and I think she mentioned The Boy,
but am not sure. It was a sin to Jack, she said, and a
disgrace to our family, and would make me a by-word
with every decent person in Lovering.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Between Katy’s tears and Miss Errington’s scorn I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>was so limp and crushed that I might have given it up if
the Colonel had not come to my rescue.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘There has been enough of this,’ he said, sternly,
‘come to breakfast, time is passing.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“He put his arm around me and led me to the dining-room,
where we breakfasted alone. Katy was upstairs
crying and Miss Errington was ordering her valise to be
taken to her room, as she would not need it now. Her
brother, who had recovered his composure and was as
quiet and calm and cool as ever, suggested that she still
go with us and take Katy. But she declined. Katy, I
think, wished to go, and clung to me at parting in a way
which wholly upset me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘Remember Jack,’ she whispered to me, ‘have pity
on him and give it up. It is not too late, and will not be
till the very last.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“Was there ever a girl more wretched on her wedding
day than I was, I wonder? Of the journey to New York
I can recall very little, except that the Colonel was unremitting
in his care for my comfort, and that once when
he spread his rug across my lap I smiled on him and said
‘You are very kind.’ Aside from that I hardly spoke,
but sat leaning back in my chair with my eyes closed,
sometimes asleep, for I was perfectly exhausted, and sometimes
thinking, always the same thought, ‘It is not too late
yet.’ The words were whispered into my ears continually
by something which seemed to be sitting on my
shoulder and croaking, until I was nearly mad. There
was, however, a comfort in knowing that I could still draw
back, and I counted how many hours probation were left
me before it would be too late. Jack will hardly suffer
more than I did during that rapid journey, when to everything
else, was added homesickness for The Elms, and you
and the dear old life I was throwing away. It was a kind
of nightmare, I think, and by the time our train was nearing
Jersey City I had made up my mind to jump from the
car the moment we stopped and lose myself in the crowd;
in short, to run away! The bustle and excitement at the
station and the hurrying to the boat revived me. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>thing on my shoulder stopped its croaking, and the Colonel
had my arm in his and held my hand tightly as if he
divined my thoughts. So the newspapers lost an exciting
paragraph headed ‘Strange disappearance of a bride on
her wedding day.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“When we reached the hotel and were ushered into the
suite of rooms the Colonel had ordered for us I felt better,
and when Mr. and Mrs. Darcy, friends of the Colonel,
who board at the hotel and whom I had met when I
stopped there with Miss Errington, came in to see me and
made much of me as the future Mrs. Errington, I was
quite myself, and all through dinner, which they took
with us and which was served in our private parlor, I was
in high spirits, too high, I fear, as I saw them look
curiously at me once or twice, as if wondering whether I
were quite sane. After dinner the three conferred in low
tones, while I stood with my back to them looking into
the busy street below and vaguely wondering if it
would break one’s neck to jump from the second story to
the sidewalk, and if one could so manage as not to land
on the head of some pedestrian. I heard the Colonel
say, ‘As soon as possible now. I have dispatched a messenger
boy.’ I knew what he meant and grew hot and
cold again in a minute, while the creature on my shoulder
began its warning cry, ‘Not too late yet,’ and pressed so
close to my ears that I fancied it touched my hair with its
wings. In the car I had thought of Poe’s raven, but now
I said to myself, ‘It is a bat.’ I have a mortal terror of
bats and put up my hand to brush it away. But it stayed
and clamored louder and louder, while I kept trying to
brush it off, until Mrs. Darcy came to me and said, ‘There
is a lock of hair loose on your neck. I think that is what
annoys you. Let me fix it.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“She took out a hairpin and fastened the refractory
lock, while I wondered if she would see the thing on my
shoulder. She didn’t, and I began to fear I was losing
my mind, and made a great effort to pull myself together.
There was a knock at the door and the Rev. Mr. Gillson
came in, book in hand, ready for business. I was presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to him, and the Colonel explained as a reason for
this seemingly sudden marriage that I could not decide to
brave the ocean in the winter until the night before. The
clergyman bowed and looked very searchingly at me as I
stood in the corner with a face white as a corpse. If
Mr. and Mrs. Darcy had not been his parishioners he
might have questioned me, thinking me an unwilling bride.
But they were my vouchers and Col. Errington was well
known to him by reputation. It was all right and the
ceremony began, while the bat, if bat it were, shrieked
and fluttered and flapped, until it seemed to me they must
all hear it. But when the Colonel took the ring, it gave
one despairing cry, ‘Too late, too late!’ and flew away,
leaving me calm and quiet, with a strange hallucination
of the brain. It was Jack putting the ring on my finger,—Jack’s
voice, which said, ‘With this ring I thee wed,
with all my worldly goods I thee endow.’ I smiled as I
thought how few were his worldly goods, compared to
what might have been mine, but I was glad that the nightmare
was over, the horrid dream passed, and I awake
again in the old spare room at home with Jack at my side.
I was very much awake when Mr. and Mrs. Darcy kissed
me and called me ‘Mrs. Errington,’ while somebody,
who was not Jack, kissed me and called me his wife.
The room at The Elms resolved itself into the parlor at the
hotel, and Jack was lost to me forever by my own act,
and I felt like a block of stone as I received the congratulations
of the clergyman and felt that the Colonel’s eyes
were upon me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have read somewhere that in the great crises of one’s
life the most ridiculous thoughts will sometimes intrude,
and there came to me a saying I have heard father use so
often when I was fretting over some disaster, ‘Never
cry for spilled milk!’ It helped me wonderfully. I had
spilled all mine,—a brimming pail, and drowned my heart
in doing it. I could never undo what I had done, but I
could make the best of it, and I mean to. I have written
you thus fully because I wanted you to know that I am
not altogether callous, and that I did struggle against my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>fate. A stronger will than mine conquered me. I am
Col. Errington’s wife and shall be faithful to him, and
however my heart may ache for the might have been, no
one, not even you, shall know it. My husband——. I
have written the word, and feel better,—is very kind
and generous. He knows I did not marry him for love,
and I think he means me to have my price,—<em>all the money
I want</em>. His wedding present is $10,000, to do with
as I please. Half of it I shall send to you, as I know how
low our finances are. He does not object. He thought
I would do it, he said, and has made arrangements to send
it before we sail. He has bought me a lovely fur cloak
for the voyage, and given me two one hundred dollar bills
for pin money. More than I ever had in all my life. One
of the bills I am sending to Jack in payment for what he
sent me on the pretense of buying Black Beauty. I
bought the tailor-made gown with it, my wedding gown,
which I am wearing now, and which I can not bear to think
was bought with Jack’s money. Make him take it. Tell
him it is to buy Black Beauty back, and don’t let him hate
me. Tell him I did love him dearly and am afraid I do
now when to do so is a sin. I am another man’s wife, and
my husband has come in and says I have but little more
time, as he wishes to get settled in our staterooms before
the ship sails. I wonder if I shall throw myself into the sea.
Perhaps. If you hear of an ‘accidental drowning of the
lovely young bride of the Hon. George W. Errington,’—that’s
the way they will word it,—you will know it was
not accidental, but keep it to yourself.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have not time to read what I have written. If I had
I probably should not send it. I think I have told you
everything in a wild, disconnected and perhaps contradictory
way, and I have felt disconnected and wild as I
told it. You may show this letter to Miss Errington, who
still intends going to The Elms with Katy. Perhaps she
will feel less hard towards me. You may also tell Jack
some things that are in it and which I could not write to
him. Oh, Jack, oh Annie! Good-bye, Good-bye! I put
my arms around your necks and kiss you both. God bless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>you. Write to me and tell me about Jack. The Colonel
will cable from Queenstown. He is getting impatient and
to save time has directed the envelope for me. Good-bye,
again.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter X.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE EFFECT.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>Fanny’s handwriting was never very legible, and now it
was worse than usual, while her letter was so long and my
eyes so blurred with tears that it took me a long time to
read it, and after it was read I leaned back in my chair
shaking from head to foot, with a sense of loss and shame
and pity for us all who must bear the disgrace, for such I
felt Fan’s conduct to be. I pitied her, but not as I did
Jack, who was so full of anticipations of the morrow and
so little prepared for the blow awaiting him. I heard him
come whistling up the stairs, two at a time, and involuntarily
put up my hands to ward him off,—to keep him a
little longer from what I knew would be worse than death.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hallo!” he said, as he came in. “I didn’t expect to
be gone so long, but those stupid men didn’t seem to
understand the range at all, and I’ll be hanged if I know
much more than they do. Mother always used a fireplace,
you know. But I reckon we have got it into shipshape.
If not, Norah can fix it when she comes. Why,
Annie, Annie!” he exclaimed suddenly, struck by my
attitude and the expression of my face, “Are you ill?
What has happened? You are as white as a ghost, and
the rain beating in upon you, too.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>He shut the window and continued, as the letter in my
lap rustled a little. “You have had bad news. Is it
Carl? Is he ill? Is he dead?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I shook my head, and he went on: “What is it then?
What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c014'>As he stepped back his eye fell upon the note directed
to him, which lay upon the table. He recognized his
name, and the handwriting, and catching it up, he said,
“From Fanny; how did it get here? Did it come in that
letter from New York, which you said was from Col.
Errington?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I nodded and managed to gasp, “Oh Jack, oh Jack!
How will you bear it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bear what?” he asked. “Tell me; the suspense is
torture to me. Has anything happened to Fanny? She
isn’t dead or she could not write to me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Summoning all my strength, I answered. “No, Jack,
Fanny is not dead. It is worse than that. She is married
to Col. Errington and gone with him to Europe.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I have heard Jack tell with a shudder of men at his side
in battle dropping instantly when a ball struck them,
but surely no man in the fiercest battle which ever raged
could have fallen more suddenly than Jack did into the
chair nearest to him, where he sat huddled together like
an old man, his mouth open and his glazed eyes looking
at me in dumb despair.</p>

<p class='c014'>“N-n-no, Annie,” he began at last, with quivering
lips and chin and in a voice I would never have known as
his. “N-n-no, Annie. Say it again. I didn’t hear you
right. There’s a roaring in my ears. Fanny—isn’t—married!
My—Fanny, who was to have this room, and
watch for me. N-n-no, Annie, N-no.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a huskiness in his voice which frightened me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>and a moan like one in mortal pain, which made me forget
myself in my desire to comfort him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t Jack,” I said, going up to him and rubbing his
cold hands and face, which was not pale but of a greenish
hue. “Don’t take it so hard. She is my sister, but
if she were ten times that I should say she is not worth
the anguish you are enduring. She has sold herself for
money. She was married Friday evening in New York
and sailed in the Celtic Saturday afternoon. She had a
hard struggle before she decided to do what she has done.
I think she loves you still.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As I talked the greenish hue left his face and was succeeded
by a deathly pallor, as, reaching out his hand, he
said, “Give me her letter.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yours, you mean,” I said, offering him the note addressed
to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,—yours. I have a right to know all she can
say,” he answered, and his voice was not like the Jack of
an hour ago. There was a ring in it like one who would
be obeyed. “I don’t care what she has written to <em>me</em>;
to <em>you</em> she would tell the truth. Give me her letter,” he
continued.</p>

<p class='c014'>I gave it to him and then watched him as he read it
rapidly in the waning light of that dreary November afternoon,
with the rain beating against the windows, and the
wind which was beginning to rise howling around the
house, as Fanny said it howled the night she wrote the
letter. It was curious to watch the different expressions
of Jack’s face as his eyes went over the pages. Sometimes
his breath came heavily, his teeth shut tightly together
and there were great ridges in his forehead between
his eyes. Again his face softened and his lips quivered
and I knew he was reading the parts where Fan spoke of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>him. I knew, too, when he reached the Scales and the
weighing process by the throwing up of his head and the
flaring of his nostrils like one under strong excitement.
Once he brought his hand down heavily upon the arm of
his chair, and if I had ever heard him swear I should have
suspected that something like an oath escaped him. Then
he read on until he came to the marriage scene in the
hotel, when his whole aspect changed. The hardness was
gone and he shook like one in a chill, although he asked
me to open the window again, saying he could not breathe.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Fanny; Fanny, how could you do this to me, who
loved and trusted you so!” he said, and letting the
letter drop to the floor and covering his face with his
hands he rocked to and fro and cried as I had never seen
any one cry before, and pray I never may again. And
yet he shed no tears, but sobbed and moaned so pitifully
that I went to him again and laying my arm across his
shoulder drew his hot head down upon it as I would if he
had been my brother.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was then no thought of the love I had borne him
so long; it was only intense pity for the man whose heart
I knew was breaking, and whom I tried to comfort.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t, Jack; don’t,” I said, brushing back his hair,
which was wet with the great drops of sweat which stood
under it and upon his forehead. “I wish I could comfort
you. Oh, I wish I could, but only God can do that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he started, and looking at me fiercely exclaimed,
“Don’t speak to me of God. I have lost all faith in everything.
Didn’t I trust Him, and wasn’t my heart so full of
gratitude this morning for all the good I thought He had
given me! And didn’t I make resolutions for a better life?
Tell me that. And what has come of it? When I was on
my knees thanking Him for Fanny and asking that I might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>be worthy, she was another man’s wife, and He gave me no
sign, but let me go on in my fool’s paradise. How could
God do that? How could Fanny do it? Oh, Fanny,
Fanny! If you were lying dead here in what was to have
been our bridal chamber it would be happiness compared
to this. Don’t speak to me, Annie. Don’t touch me,” and
he pushed me from him. “It seems to bring Fanny near
to me, and I can’t bear it now, when my love for her is
dying so hard. Shut the window, please. I am shivering
again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I closed the window and then stood looking at him
writhing in pain, as if he were indeed enduring the throes
of death. It was growing late and I roused him at last,
pointing to the darkness outside and telling him that Paul
and Phyllis would be waiting anxiously for us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you get your horse, or shall I?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll go,” he said, getting up and tottering as if he
were an old man.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the table where he had lain it without reading was
Fanny’s note to him, and I put it in my purse with the bill
which had been in my letter and which I had not given
him. I heard the buggy at the door, and going out got
in beside him and we started down the hill. It was raining
fast and had grown very dark. If the horse had not
been perfectly gentle and known every turn of the road,
we might have met with some disaster, for the reins hung
loosely in Jack’s hands and he seemed to notice nothing.
Once we met a carriage which passed so close to us that
the wheels grazed each other, but Jack paid no attention.
Then I took the lines from him and drove myself, while
he sat with his head bent so low that his chin must have
rested upon his chest. Once I spoke to him, but he did
not answer, and when we reached the town I called to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>boy on the walk bidding him to go for a physician and
tell him to come at once to The Elms, adding that Mr.
Fullerton had been taken suddenly ill. I had no intention
of having Jack in his present condition go to his boardinghouse
that night. He would be better at The Elms, and
after speaking to the boy I drove rapidly home. There
was a bright light in the dining-room and Paul’s face was
pressed against the window pane watching for me. At
the sound of wheels Phyllis hurried to the door, peering
out into the darkness and shading her eyes with her hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“For de Lord’s sake, Miss Annie and Mas’r Jack,”
she began. “Whar has you been, and what has happened
you? De muffins is all fell flat, an’ de coffee biled till it’s
spiled.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sh-sh,” I said warningly. “Bring a light, and come
and help me; Mr. Fullerton is ill,—very ill, I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She had a candle at the door in a minute and was at
my side, as I sprang to the ground after giving Jack a
vigorous shake which roused him a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes. Where are we? At home? All right. I’ll
see you to-morrow before she comes,” he said, putting
out his hand and feeling for the lines.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jack, you are to stay at The Elms with me,” I said,
wondering how I was to make him get out if he were
disposed not to do so.</p>

<p class='c014'>Just then I heard the tramp of horses’ feet in the avenue
and the doctor came riding up rapidly. He was just starting
to visit a patient in the country when he received my
message and came at once to know what had happened.
Between him and Phyllis Jack was gotten into the house,
his weakness and silence so alarming that I was relieved
when, as he felt the warmth of the dining-room, he stretched
his hands toward the light-wood fire and said, “Ah-h,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>that feels good. I think I must have taken cold. I am
so chilly. I wish somebody would cover up Robin,” referring
to his horse, of which he was very fond. Sinking
into the chair which Phyllis drew close to the hearth, he
gave a long sigh, leaned his head back and closed his eyes,
while the doctor looked curiously at him and then at me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is in a high fever,” he said, “although he seems
so cold. How did the attack come on and what caused
it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not explain then, and answered evasively.
“He must stay here to-night, in father’s room, and the
sooner you get him in there the better,” I said, telling
Phyllis to kindle a fire and get the bed ready. I knew the
condition of things better than the doctor, who, for a
time, acted under my orders. At first Jack resisted, saying
he must go home as his landlady would not like it if
he kept supper waiting. Then he began to talk of Scales
and Maelstroms, and Fanny, who was coming to-morrow.
We got him quiet at last and into bed where he lay perfectly
still, with his hands folded, his eyes closed and his
face white as the pillow it rested upon.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can’t make it out,” the doctor said. “It is not
often a young and strong man like him comes down so
suddenly and so fast. Why, there is no more life in him
than in a piece of paper. Looks to me as if he had received
some great mental shock. Can’t account for it in any
other way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Reflecting that on the morrow when Miss Errington
and Katy came without Fanny the truth must be told, I
replied, “He has had a shock. You know he was to have
been married on Christmas day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The doctor nodded, and I went on slowly, with a feeling
that my tongue was very thick.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“This evening I had a letter from Fanny, who has
married Col. Errington and gone to Europe with him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The doctor dropped into the chair nearest him almost
as quickly as Jack had dropped when I told the news to
him. But he did not speak, for Fanny was my sister and
he would not say what was in his mind. I, however, relieved
him from all embarrassment by saying, “It has
quite unnerved me. It came like a thunderclap. I had
no suspicion of it. I think it a cruel, wicked act.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes, all of that,” he answered, “and may have
serious results. There are symptoms about Mr. Fullerton
which I do not like. He is strong in everything pertaining
to his manhood, but in his nature gentle and tender
and trustful as a woman. The blow has struck him hard.
See that he has his medicine regularly. I will be here
early in the morning. Now, I must go, as I have a patient
waiting for me three miles in the country.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He went out and I followed him, meeting in the hall
with Phyllis, who was eager in her inquiries for Mas’r Jack
and what had “done took him so suddently.” I told her
the truth, and if a negro can turn pale she certainly did.
Throwing up her hands and dropping the cup of milk she
was taking to Paul, who was clamoring for his supper, she
staggered against the door, exclaiming, “Lor’ a ’mighty!
What for has Miss Fanny gone done dat ar mean trick to
Mas’r Jack, an’ a disgracin’ de whole of us. No weddin’,—no
nothin’,—an’ sich gossip in de town. Gone to
Europe has she in de big ship?” I nodded and she continued,
“May de Lord s——.” She was going to say
“sink de ship,” but changed her mind and added, “may
he make her so sick she’ll heave up Jonah an’ that Cunnel
too. I ’members him well fust time he was
here, orderin’ dem soldiers roun’ as if dey was dirt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Jess so he’ll done order Miss Fanny, and sarve her
right.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A moan from Jack and an imperative call from Paul
brought the interview to an end, and while Phyllis went
to the one I hastened to the other, who was talking rather
wildly. This did not greatly surprise me as I remembered
having heard his mother say that whenever anything ailed
him, if it were only the earache, to which as a boy he was
subject, it made him delirious. It was more than earache
now, and I tried to quiet him as he talked disconnectedly
of several things, but mostly of Fanny and the house on
The Plateau, and <em>our room</em>, wondering if she would like
it, and the medallion on the bedstead which looked so
much like her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I love her so! I love her so! How can I give her up!”
he suddenly exclaimed, throwing his arms down with great
force upon the spread, while the perspiration rolled down
his face, and his eyes glared at me questioningly and then
wandered swiftly around the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>He wanted to go home, he said; this was no place for him,
and Fanny coming to-morrow. Once he tried to get up,
but I kept him back, telling him to wait till to-morrow,
when I hoped he would be better.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What little dark-faced woman are you, I’d like to
know, trying to boss me?” he said, looking curiously at
me, as I kept my arm across his chest. “You can’t hold
a candle to Fanny. Where is she? You go away and
send her here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I knew he was not conscious of what he was saying, but
in my nervous condition his words hurt me, and my voice
shook as I replied, “Fanny has not come yet. You
didn’t expect her till to-morrow. I am Annie. Don’t you
know me Jack?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Something in my voice arrested his attention, and looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>fixedly at me he said, “You want to cry, don’t you?
Put your head down here and have it out.” With one
hand he drew my head down upon his other hand and kept
it there, while I cried like a child. It was his part to
comfort me now, and he tried to do so, asking why I
cried and what had happened.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Something has, I know; but I can’t remember what
it is,” he said. “But never mind. We’ll meet it bravely
together, little Annie-mother, and Fanny will be here to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>That thought comforted him, and many times during the
night as I sat by him he asked if it were to-morrow yet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The to-morrow, you know, when <em>she</em> is coming,” he
would add, and to this I could truthfully answer no, even
when it was the dawn of the to-morrow he had anticipated
so much and the grey morning was looking in at the windows.</p>

<p class='c014'>At an early hour Phyllis came to relieve me, and shivering
in every limb and with my head aching as if it
would burst, I crept up to my bed, where I fell at once
into a heavy sleep which lasted for hours. When I awoke
both Phyllis and the doctor were with me. The latter
held a telegram from Katy, saying that she and Miss Errington
would come that day as they had arranged. My
first inquiry was for Jack.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am afraid he is in for brain fever,” the doctor said.
“He has been working very hard lately, and this, with
the wetting he got last night and the terrible blow have
proved more than he can bear. He is apt to be flighty
from pain anyway and is crazy as a loon this morning
and is asking first if it is to-morrow, then for Fanny and
then for Annie-mother. That I reckon is you, but you
are better where you are for a day or so, or I shall have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>two on my hands, and I fancy Jack will be about as much
as I can manage.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I must get up,” I said, trying to rise, when a
sharp pain in the back of my head pulled me back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I told you so,” the doctor said. “You’ve got neuralgia
in your neck. You never changed your wet clothes
at all last night, Phyllis says, and if you don’t look out
you’ll have pneumonia and the Lord knows what else.
You must keep quiet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I had no choice but to obey, the pain in my neck was
so severe, and were I to try I could not narrate what
came with and followed that to-morrow of which Jack had
talked so much and which was ushered in so sadly. This
task devolves upon another.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PART III.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>FAN-AND-ANN AND JACK.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.—Author’s Story.</span><br> <span class='c013'>HOW LOVERING RECEIVED THE NEWS.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>The news that Fanny Hathern had jilted Jack Fullerton
and married Col. Errington flew like wild-fire and set the
little town of Lovering ablaze with excitement and indignation.
The doctor had told it to his wife the night after
his return from The Elms, adding that she’d better keep
dark until she heard it from some other source. But
whether she kept dark or not everybody knew it by ten
o’clock the next morning. Women who had not called
upon their neighbors for weeks remembered suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>that they had an errand, and were seen hurrying through
the streets talking to everyone they met and then hastening
on to other listeners, who in turn told it to all whom
they saw. By twelve o’clock the story had received the
addition that Jack Fullerton was at The Elms raving with
brain fever and likely to die as the result of Col. Errington’s
perfidy. Usually it is the woman who gets the most
censure; in this case it was the man, whom all remembered
as the haughty officer who had come into their
midst with his troops and levied upon them for whatever
he wished to have. And now he had put the crowning
act to his other misdeeds by running off with Fanny Hathern
and possibly causing Jack Fullerton’s death. There
had hardly been more excitement in town when the news
first came that Sumter had fallen than there was now.
Even the men stopped each other to discuss it, and nowhere
were there louder or more indignant voices heard
than just outside a small corner grocery which bore the
sign, “Sam Slayton, dealer in the finest groceries and
freshest vegetables this side of the Potomac.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Sam was a character. A long, lean, light-haired Yankee
from Vermont, who, three or four years before had
come to Lovering and opened a grocery, with the boast
that he was “goin’ to show them Southerners a thing or
two.” He had been in the Federal army and had passed
through Lovering with some of his company, spending
the night there and “painting the town red,” as he expressed
it, in the confession he made when he came back
a second time with the intention of settling. He was
young then and out on a big lark and he had it, and stole
a hen from “widder” Simmons’s roost, and some
“aigs” from another, and threw a stone at a boy who
called him a mud-sill. It missed the boy and broke a
window light in a tin-shop.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“But lan sakes,” he added, “I was a boy then. I’m
a man now, and different. I’m converted, and have
brought money to pay for the hen and the aigs and the
pane of glass. I liked the looks of your pretty little town
among the Virginny hills and thought I’d like to live
here, and when Mirandy,—that’s the girl I’m engaged
to, she’s weakly, and coughs,—and when she said she’d
live longer in a milder climate than Vermont, I thought
of Lovering, and here I am, and as soon as I get a little forehanded,
with a house to live in, I shall fetch Mirandy
down, and a better woman you never seen.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was what Sam said to the people with whom he
had come to live, never doubting in his simple heart that
he should be received into favor at once. But war prejudices
died hard, especially at the south where the feeling
of having been conquered rankled the most and longest.
No one who looked in Sam’s honest face doubted his integrity
or good feeling, but he was from the north,—he
had fought against them, and although they took his cash
for the stolen property, and knew that his store was
brighter and cleaner and his groceries better than any in
Lovering, their patronage was slow in coming. For four
years he had held his ground valiantly, with but little
more hope of making Mirandy his wife than when he first
started in business. Once when a knot of men were
seated upon the comfortable seats he had himself built on
two sides of his grocery so that “tired folks could rest
themselves and see all that was going on around the four
corners,” he held forth feelingly on the subject, asking
why under the sun and moon they didn’t trade with him
as well as to <em>sit</em> on his benches.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is it because I fit you? Bless your souls, I buried the
ax, handle and all, the minute the last gun was fired, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>I gin the shirt on my back for a piller for one of your fellows
I found dyin’ in the Wilderness, and I hear his God
bless you, just before he died, now. I didn’t blame him
an atom, nor you nuther. If I’d been born south I’d of
jined you of course. As I was from the north I jined the
Federal army and would do it agin; not that I had any
spite agin you personally, but for the flag,—the principle,—not
the nigger. Da——! I beg pardon, I don’t
swear now. I took my chances and got stuck into Libby
prison, where I didn’t lead the most luxurious life. But
lan, sakes, ’twas the fate of war, and I never complained,
nor said a word but once, and that when a chap brought
me some beef no human could eat. Says I, ‘No you don’t
get that stuff into my stomach. I’m fond of fresh meat,
but darned if I’ll eat maggits.’ He smiled and said low:
‘I don’t blame you. It’s the best I can do. Our boys
up to Chicago are eatin’ <em>rat</em> pies.’ ‘Rats,’ I said, ‘Lord
of heavens, give me rats, by the million. They’re dainties
to this vermin.’ ‘You bet,’ he said, and pulled a
cracker out of his pocket and handed me on the sly. I
guess he had some tobacker in with it by the flavor, but
I never tasted a better cracker than that. The first greenback
I got after I left Libby I sent to him. He’s up
north now, the best reconstructed reb you ever see,—married
my sister and got twin boys; calls ’em Jefferson
Davis and Abraham Lincoln. That’s the way to do
things.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This speech of Sam’s was received with shouts of
laughter and three cheers for the twins, Abraham Lincoln
and Jefferson Davis, while one man ordered half of a codfish
and another bought a cigar. Here their patronage
stopped, but it is a long lane which never turns and Sam’s
was destined to turn at last by a few chance words spoken
at the right time.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>On their way home a knot of men met and seated themselves
upon Sam’s benches, eagerly discussing the news
of the morning which was in everyone’s mouth and
greatly exaggerated by this time. Jack was going to die,
and the Colonel had run off with Fanny Hathern against
her will. Whether he had married her or not was a question.
Probably not, and dire was the vengeance declared
against him by the workmen gathered near Sam’s door.
Among them sat Sam, a big knife in his hand, and sticking
to it a thin slice of rich cream cheese, which he passed
from one to another, asking if they ever tasted anything
better than that, and telling them Mirandy made it on her
father’s farm in Vermont. Among those who denounced
Col. Errington no one was louder than Sam.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know him, root and branch,” he said, with a flourish
of his cheese knife. “I was in his regiment part of
the time till I got took and shut up in Libby, and a
meaner man never rode a hoss into battle. Brave enough,
but has a temper hard and cruel, and no more feelin’ than
a stun. Cap’n Fullerton is wuth a thousand such men as
Col. Errington, and so Miss Hathern will find to her sorrer.
I b’lieve he merried her though. She ain’t the stuff
as would go with him without the ceremony, but I tell
you agin she’s flung overboard a gentleman for as mean
and unprincipled a <em>cuss</em> as ever walked. Smooth and
polished outside with his equals, but inwardly,—what’s
that the scripter says about <em>inwardly</em>, I or’to know, but
my mem’ry fails me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The memories of all the audience failed them, if they
had any, and, besides, they were rather actively dodging
the cheese knife which was flourishing at a great rate as
Sam waxed eloquent on the subject of Col. Errington.
They knew Sam had been in his regiment and half expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>he would try to defend him, but he denounced him
more hotly than they had done, and every shred of prejudice,
if they really had any, against the kind-hearted
man slipped away. He was a good sort after all, and
one of them remembered that he wanted some plug tobacco
and asked if he had any good.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tons of it. Want some?” Sam replied, entering
his store and bringing out the tobacco.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another man suddenly bethought him that his wife had
told him not to come home without coffee. He had intended
getting it at the Red Cross grocery, where he
always traded, but he ordered it of Sam, who, when the
scale showed just a pound, put in a little more.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good weight is my rule,” he said, as he tied up the
package and hastened to weigh out another.</p>

<p class='c014'>The aroma of his Mocha and Java mixed had filled the
store, and his coffee was in great demand, as well as his
cheese. Sugar and eggs followed next, and never had he
done so thriving a business in any two hours as in the
half hour which followed his vituperation against Col.
Errington.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If I keep on this way, I can have Mirandy down next
fall,” he thought, as he counted his gains that night and
carried his tin box to the little room over his grocery
where he had slept for the last four years.</p>

<p class='c014'>While the men talked the matter over in the streets
and the post-office and hotel, and in front of Sam’s store,
the women were just as busy. The friends of the Hatherns,—the
upper crust, as they were called by those who
felt themselves to be the <em>under crust</em>,—gathered in each
other’s parlors and discussed it quietly, while another
class of women and children, twenty or more, felt irresistibly
drawn to the house on The Plateau. They had seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>it a hundred times and some of them had been over it
when it was open to the public, but now that the bride
for whom it was built would never occupy it, it was invested
with a new interest, and after dinner they walked
up the hill and around the house, staring at the windows
and roofs and chimneys and wishing they could get in and
see the fine fixings they had heard were there. When
they reached the rear door they saw in it the key which
Jack in his excitement had forgotten to remove. This
they looked upon as a special interposition of Providence
in their behalf and one of which they immediately availed
themselves. Wiping their muddy feet carefully upon the
mat they filed into the house which, with no one to restrain
them, they examined curiously and minutely, commenting
freely as they went, but for the most part favorably, upon
what they saw, wondering what it all cost and if Jack could
afford it. His mother, they knew, did not leave him
much, and they never supposed he had a great deal laid
up. Consequently, he must have borrowed the money for
all this finery, the like of which they did not believe was
to be found in Richmond, no, nor in Washington either.
The bridal chamber attracted them most. Into this they
entered very quietly, speaking as low and stepping as softly
as we do when we go into the chamber of death. It had
been the scene of the death of all Jack’s hopes, and they
sat in the chair where he had sat when he read the fatal
letter, and tried the chair in the bay window where Fanny
was to sit and watch for him, and admired the dainty
white spread and pillow-shams and medallion which they
mistook for Fanny’s portrait, and some of the more curious
lifted the bedclothes to see what was under them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A hair mattress a foot thick, as I live. I reckon that
cost a heap,” one said, while another pronounced it a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>piece of extravagance, knowing as she did that “old Miss
Fullerton had left five or six good feather-beds,—geese
feathers, too!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Next to the bridal chamber, the upright Steinway in the
parlor below attracted their attention most, and as they
found it unlocked several fingers were soon drumming on
the keys, which Jack had said no hands should touch until
Fanny had played him his favorite airs. Poor Jack!
When the house had been thoroughly inspected and pronounced
good enough for a queen to live in, it was nearly
time for the Richmond train. It was generally known in
town that Miss Errington and Katy Hathern were expected,
and the women decided to go round to the station
and see if they came. They had known Katy all her life,
and ordinarily would scarcely have walked half a block
out of their way just to see her. Recent events, however,
had made a change, and then they were anxious to see
Miss Errington, who, as sister of the man who had married
Fanny Hathern so hurriedly, was an object of greater
curiosity than Katy herself. Others in Lovering were
of the same mind, and at least fifty people, black and
white, of both sexes and all ages, were assembled upon
the platform when the 4 o’clock train came in, stopping
farther down than usual so that the ladies who were in the
rear car did not alight in the midst of the crowd, jostling
and pushing each other for a sight of them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There they be; that’s Miss Katy. How tall and pale
she looks, and how becoming that gown is to her, and,
yes, that must be Miss Errington. How proud she looks;
stylish, though,” were the remarks which passed from lip
to lip as Katy and her friend stopped for a moment, half
bewildered by the number of people who did not attempt
to come nearer, but stood staring at them.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>“There’s Dr. Carter,” Katy exclaimed joyfully, as she
saw the doctor elbowing his way to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>He had expected something of the kind which had happened,
and had come to meet the ladies in a close carriage
which was standing in the rear of the station.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I am so glad, and why are all these people here?
What has happened?” Katy said, as she gave both
hands to the doctor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing; nothing. Just out for an airing; you know
you are a traveled individual, and they want to see if you
have changed,” the doctor said laughingly, as he took off
his hat to Miss Errington, whose satchel his servant was
taking.</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy understood and her face was scarlet. She was
sharing in Fanny’s notoriety and paying in part the penalty
of her wrong-doing. Had Fanny been there she
would have held her head high and walked over the
crowd without seeing it. Katy was of different fibre and
shrank from the curious eyes. But when, as she passed
through their midst so many greeted her with “How
d’ye, Miss Katy, glad to see you home again,” she
began to lose the feeling that some blame or disgrace was
attaching to her, and smiled upon them through the tears
she could not repress. A moment more and she, with
Miss Errington, was in the carriage and driving rapidly
toward The Elms.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>All day Jack had been flighty and talked continually.
Sometimes he was in the war, ready for battle, and was
pointing out Col. Errington to his men. “That’s he,”
he would say; “that tall, straight officer on the big black
horse, holding himself as loftily as if he owned every
foot of the south. Spot him, and fire at him and at no
one else until you see him fall.” Again, he was at The
Plateau, reading the cruel letter, parts of which had
burned themselves into his brain. “It took Errington
and his money, and the dreary life at Lovering she so
much dreaded to tip the scale and send me flying, after
all;” he said to Phyllis, who, half beside herself, was
kept going from the kitchen to him, from him to Annie,
and from Annie back to the kitchen and Paul, who, neglected
and feeling vaguely that something was wrong,
was crying for Fan-er-nan to come and bring him the
horse she had promised him in one of her letters. Fanny’s
name Jack never mentioned. It was “she,” or “her,”
or, “the little girl on the headboard,” who, he said, was
laughing at his coarse clothes and country ways, and he
asked Phyllis to take her away before he split the headboard
in pieces. He did make an attempt at it, but
Phyllis restrained him, telling him “there wan’t any gal
there laughing at him.” Jack insisted there was, and was
threatening to split poor old Phyllis’s head open if she
didn’t put her out, when the doctor came in for the second
time and with him a neighbor who was to stay that day at
least, and longer if necessary. To him Jack at once appealed
with regard to the mocking girl on the headboard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>growing so wild and unmanageable that the bedstead was
finally exchanged for a cot which had no headboard.
Then Jack grew quiet, but asked for the little woman,
Annie-mother, who had cried with him and helped him
drive home. Where was she? Had she gone back on
him, too, and was it to-morrow, yet? If so, he must get
up, for <em>she</em> was coming and he must go to meet her. On
his flushed face there was an eager look as he said <em>she</em>
is coming, but it faded almost as soon as it came, and
was succeeded by one of inexplicable pain as some wave
of memory brought the truth in part to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it I am trying to remember?” he asked.
“What was it that swooped down so suddenly upon me,
blotting out everything and making me doubt even God
himself? Annie-mother knows; call her. Tell her <em>I</em>
want her,—Jack Fullerton, late of the —— Regiment of
Volunteers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Annie-mother was too ill to go to him. Two or
three times she had tried to rise, and as often had given
it up, mastered by the cutting pain in her right temple
and behind her ear. The long time she had sat by the
open window with the cold November rain and wind beating
upon her, had borne fruit in a severe attack of neuralgia,
which made it impossible for her to rise, and she lay
listening intently to every sound below and wondering
how Phyllis would get through the day without her, and
wishing that Miss Errington were not coming. Friend
after friend came in offering their services, which seemed
to be needed in the kitchen quite as much as elsewhere,
for Phyllis had lost her head with worriment, as she expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I kin woller through with the work,” she said, while
the tears rolled down her black face. “It’s the disgrace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>to the family I feel the wust,—the dido Miss Fanny done
cut up, and broke Mas’r Jack’s heart smack in two. I
hearn it snap myself. An’ Miss Annie feels een ’most as
bad as if she done it herself, bein’ she’s Miss Fanny’s
twin, an’ they two were boun together like dem ar Simon
twins, what you call ’em. Oh, dat I had died in de wah,
or runned away, afore I done got so I dunno my dish cloth
from de han’-towel, an’ uses ’em promiscous, an’ Miss
Katy comin’ to-night, an’ dat ar Miss Errin’ton. I wish
to de Lord she’d staid away.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was said to some ladies who were interviewing
Phyllis in her kitchen, which was in wild disorder, while
the old woman herself was wilder, and once as she talked
came near seating herself on the range instead of the stool
she was looking for. As a result three or four negroes were
sent to The Elms from as many different houses, and when
the carriage containing Miss Errington and Katy drove
up there was a group of dusky faces peering from the windows
of the kitchen, where none of them knew what to
do, and each one was so much in the others’ way and in
Phyllis’s that she had more than once been on the point
of sending them home.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, de good Lord, thar they is,” she exclaimed,
rushing to open the side door, and throwing her arms
around Katy with a force which lifted her from her feet
and nearly squeezed the breath from her body. “Bress
de dear lamb. Who’d of b’lieved you’d ever comed home
like dis yer, an’ Mas’r Jack a dyin’, an’ Miss Annie mos’
as bad, an’ me so upsot I do’ know what to do wid company,”
she said, with a side glance at Miss Errington,
who understood her at once.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t call me company,” she said, laying her hand
kindly on Phyllis’s shoulder. “I have come to help; not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>to be in the way. Show me my room, and after that I
shall wait upon myself, and you, too, if necessary.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Wholly disarmed and mollified, Phyllis conducted the
lady to her room, and after standing irresolute a while
mustered courage to say, “Has you done hearn from
her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment Miss Errington’s dark eyes flashed;
then she answered quietly, “I had a line from my brother
written on the ship just before it sailed. She was well
then, and happy, he wrote.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Happy! May the Lord forgive her. I shouldn’t
s’pose she’d sleep o’ nights,” was Phyllis’s retort, as she
bounced from the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meanwhile Katy had been busy with Paul, who was
asking for Fan-er-nan, and the horse on wheels with saddle
and bridle she was to bring him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fanny won’t come to-day, nor to-morrow, nor for
many to-morrows,” Katy said to him. “She has gone off
in a big ship, but I have brought you the horse, and a heap
more toys in my trunk, which the expressman will soon
bring to the house.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus quieted Paul drew his high chair to the window to
watch for the express wagon, while Katy went up to her
sister’s room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Katy, Katy,” Annie exclaimed, springing up,
unmindful of the pain which cut her like a knife. Throwing
her arms around her sister’s neck, she sobbed, “I am
so glad to have you back, and so sorry, too, for the sad
home coming. We meant to have it so different.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know,” Katy replied, sitting down upon the bed,
and passing her hand soothingly over the right temple
where the veins were standing out large and full.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was healing in the touch of Katy’s fingers, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>excitement had driven the pain away for the time being,
and Annie lay down upon her pillow quiet and easy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you heard from her?” she asked, in a whisper,
and Katy answered, “Just a few lines from New York
saying she was married Friday night at the hotel, and had
written you full particulars. Miss Errington also had a
note from her brother, written on the Celtic, and brought
back in the tug which accompanied it down the bay. There
were notices of the marriage in the Washington papers
and in New York. He sent them, of course.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell me what you know, and if you had any suspicion,”
Annie said, still in a whisper, as if the subject
were one of she could not speak aloud.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not the slightest, and that seems so strange,” Katy
replied. “I knew he admired her; everybody did, and
his attentions were rather marked, both in Saratoga and
Washington. She, however, seemed wholly indifferent,
even snubbed him at times, I thought, and made fun of
him to me, calling him Uncle George and bald head,
and all that. Still she was not happy, or at least she
was nervous and restless and discontented, and talked
of Lovering as a place one hundred years behind the
times, and wondered how she was ever to be contented
here after having seen the world. When buying her
trousseau she was always wishing for more money that it
might be more elaborate. Then she would laugh and say
‘What’s the use of clothes with nobody to see them but
Lovering people,—nowhere to wear them except to church
and the sewing society.’ She never talked this way before
Miss Errington, but was always amiable and seemingly
in good spirits, talking to her of the house on The
Plateau and the pleasure it would be to entertain her
there. Toward the last, however, there was a change.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Twice I found her crying, and once she wished herself dead.
When I asked her if she didn’t love Jack, she turned to
me fiercely and replied, ‘Love Jack? Yes, far more than
I wish I did. He is the best man that ever lived, or ever
will live. I wish he were not so good.’ I know now
what she meant, but had no suspicion then. Thursday we
were to do our last shopping, but she excused herself,
saying her head ached, and Miss Errington and I went
without her. When we came home her head still ached,
but she was in high spirits. I believe she sat up half
that night writing to you and packing her trunk. She
only took her best clothes. The others I have brought
home. The Colonel was to leave the next morning for
New York, and his sister and I were going with him. To
her it was a thunderbolt when he said, in his cold, decided
way, as if from what he said there could be no demur,
‘Miss Hathern has at last consented to be my wife and
go with me to Europe. She will accompany me to New
York and we shall be married this evening at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel. You can still go with me if you like, and
take Miss Katy, too.’ It was Miss Errington who told me,
and I hardly knew her she was so transformed with surprise
and indignation. She couldn’t stand she shook so, and her
face was white as marble as she said ‘It is not that I object
to seeing your sister, my brother’s wife under different
circumstances. It is the sin,—the cruelty to Mr. Fullerton,
which I deplore.’ Nothing could move Fanny from her
purpose. She had made up her mind, and could not unmake
it. Oh, Annie, it was terrible when we said good-bye
and I knew she would go. And she looked so beautiful,
too,—but as if carved in stone, as Miss Errington freed
her mind. ‘You will repent this to your dying day,’ she
said, and I wish you could have seen the hard, sneering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>look in the Colonel’s eyes as he listened. Such a look
would have made me turn back if I were already at the
altar. Fanny may have won a bed of gold, but it will
not be one of roses. She loves Jack. She does not love
Col. Errington, and he knows it, and by and by, when the
novelty is gone and the freshness of her beauty begins to
wane, God pity her,—and Jack, poor Jack, tell me about
him and how he took it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Annie’s turn now to take up the story and tell
what the reader already knows of the scene in the house on
The Plateau when Jack learned the truth and read the letter
which Katy now read with streaming eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Annie,” she said, when she had finished it.
“This is dreadful. How could she write it, and how
could you let Jack see it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He would; I had no choice in the matter,” Annie
said, adding that she still had the note written to him and
the hundred dollars sent in her letter. “I took his note
from the table where he had left it unread, and shall give
it to him when he is better. Have you seen him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not yet, but am going now,” Katy answered, as she
arose and left the room. She found Jack quiet, but greatly
changed. The last twenty-four hours had told fearfully
upon him, and his face, though flushed, was drawn
and pinched, and in his eyes there was a hopeless look
pitiful to see.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jack, do you know me? I am Katy,” she said, laying
her hand upon his hot forehead, just as she had lain it on
Annie’s.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment he regarded her intently, associating her
in some way with the to-morrow he had anticipated so
much. Then he smiled faintly and said, “Sometimes I
do, and sometimes I don’t; it comes and goes; with something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>that was to make me very glad. Is it to-morrow,
and where is Annie-mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy knew what he meant by to-morrow, as Annie had
told her, and she answered him, “Not to-morrow yet.
It is to-day, and Annie has a bad headache. She will come
to you as soon as it is better.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right,” Jack said. “Tell her I am sorry her
head aches; so does mine. I ache all over. Something
happened, I can’t think what. It comes and goes, like a
forgotten name you are trying to recall; only it isn’t a
name. I sweat so trying to remember. Annie knows;
poor little Annie. She cried with me, or for me, and the
rain fell on us and made me cold, and it was dark, oh so
dark.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At that moment Paul came running in with the horse in
his hand. It had been packed in Miss Errington’s trunk,
and when the baggage came she took it out at once for
the impatient child. He had been told not to go into the
sick-room, but seeing the door open and hearing Katy’s
voice he rushed in with his horse exclaiming, “Look
Katy, it’s come. See, Jack, what Fan-er-nan sent me.
She’s gone on a ship.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Jack caught the name, and starting up exclaimed,
“That’s what I have been trying to remember. It <em>is</em>
to-morrow and she has not come. She will never come.
Fanny, Fanny, come to me, come.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Stretching out his arms as if to embrace some one he
fell back upon his pillow, white and exhausted, while Katy
tried to quiet him. It seemed to her as if Fanny must
have heard that cry of anguish which brought both Phyllis
and Miss Errington to the door of the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My brother has much to answer for,” Miss Errington
said under her breath, while Phyllis ejaculated, “May
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the Lord forgive them!” as she hurried back to the kitchen
and her preparations for supper, which were greatly
retarded by the unsettled condition of her nerves.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am that oversot that I don’t know a corn cake from
a pone of bread, and you must s’cuse me if things ain’t
jess squar. What with de kitchen, an’ dem niggers in
my way, an’ Miss Annie an’ Mas’r Jack, I loses my balance;”
she said to Miss Errington, who came for hot
water with which to bathe Annie’s head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I tell you again not to mind me,” Miss Errington
replied. “I can take care of myself, and cook the dinner
for the others, if necessary. I know how to do everything.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You do! That beats all,” Phyllis exclaimed, placing
both hands on her hips and regarding intently the tall,
majestic lady, whose proud face, handsome dress and
white, jeweled hands looked as if they had never done so
much as to pick up her own handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c014'>But her looks belied her. Born and reared in New
York City in the midst of luxury, she was fortunate in
having had a mother who required her daughter to learn to
do everything necessary to the comfort of a household.
Orphaned soon after leaving school she had for years
presided over her brother’s house in Washington, and
often boasted that if every servant left her she could
prepare her own meals and do whatever there was to be
done, except the washing. She drew the line at that.
She had at first hesitated about coming to The Elms in
the present state of affairs, but urged by Katy, who was
greatly attached to her, she had made up her mind to do
so. The loneliness of the house in Washington would be
intolerable, and something told her that she might be of
service at The Elms. She was sure of it when she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>saw how matters were and how inefficient Phyllis was, or
rather how unequal to the emergency.</p>

<p class='c014'>“’Tain’t laziness, nor onwillin’ness; de Lord knows
I’d lay down and let ’em trample on me, if that would
help any. It’s the worrit an’ buzzin’ in my head,” she
said, when, after supper she was washing the silver and
china which Miss Errington insisted upon wiping for her.
The negroes had been sent home and Phyllis was alone,
when Miss Errington offered her services.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You look tired,” she said; and Phyllis was tired, for
she had been on her feet all day, and as soon as her dishes
were washed she sank down into a rocking chair near
the range and went fast asleep, in the midst of pots and
kettles and brushes and brooms, which would have elicited
groans of disapproval from Norah O’Rourke and alarming
creaks from her shoes, could she have seen them, under
ordinary circumstances when there was no excuse for the
untidiness.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next morning dawned dark and dreary, with a cold
November rain. Annie, who had slept quietly and late,
was so much better that she began to worry about the
kitchen arrangements.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What did you have for breakfast, and how was it
served? Phyllis is getting old and careless,” she said to
Katy, who had brushed her hair, brought her a clean
white dressing jacket and was tidying up the room in
which a bright fire, kindled before Annie was awake, was
burning.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We have not had it yet, but it is ready,” Katy replied,
with a ring of excitement in her voice. “Oat-meal and
cream, and steak and muffins and everything. You are
to have yours at once. Come in,” she added, in response
to a knock, or rather a kick upon the door, which was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>little ajar and through which Norah O’Rourke came with
a broad smile on her face and in her hands a big tray
loaded with delicacies.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Norah! Norah! Where did you come from? I am so
glad,” Annie exclaimed, and forgetting the disgust she had
felt when she saw Mrs. Hathern kissing Norah on her
first arrival at The Elms she threw her arms around the
woman’s neck and held her close, crying hysterically in
her great joy and relief in seeing her again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Norah, who had missed the express from Richmond the
day before, had come in the night train, reaching Lovering
very early that morning. In his last letter to her
Jack had told her to go at once to The Plateau. As there
was no conveyance at the station she had walked to The
Plateau, and been struck with the desolate appearance of
the house, around which there was no sign of life, although
the key was in the door. Entering she made the
tour of the house, noting everything, from the tumbled
appearance of the white spread on the bed in the bridal
chamber, where the women had inspected the hair mattress,
to the soiled footprints on the kitchen floor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where is everybody?” she thought, just as a sound
outside attracted her attention.</p>

<p class='c014'>Going out, she met a negro who looked as if he might
be prowling about rather than there for any good.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lor-a-mighty,” he exclaimed, “How you scar’t me!
I didn’t think nobody was here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where are the folks? Mr. Fullerton, I mean,” Norah
asked, and then listened wonderingly to the story the
negro told.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Fanny done run off wid anoder man, an’ Mas’r
Fullerton gone ravin’ mad wid de fever down to de Elms,
and Miss Annie jest as bad, an’ de ole Harry to pay
generally.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“And the house left alone with the key in the door.
That’s shiftlessness, and accounts for them mud tracks.
Some truck has been here,” Norah said, pocketing the
key and starting rapidly for The Elms, which she reached
just as the sun was rising and Phyllis was banging at the
range in her efforts to rekindle the fire which had gone out.</p>

<p class='c014'>To dump the grate and make a fresh fire was a sore trial
to Phyllis, who had never ceased to long for the old
kitchen under the dogwood tree.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish de whole caboose was in Tophet,” she said,
when turning round she saw Norah standing in the door
with an expression on her face which she remembered so
well.</p>

<p class='c014'>Never doubting that it was a ghost the old negress sank
down upon the range, the griddles of which were off, her
eyes taking in, as Norah’s had done, the littered condition
of the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was gwine to clar up to-day; de good Lord knows I
was,” she said apologetically, her hands thrown out to
keep Norah off as she advanced into the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t be a fool, Phyllis,” Norah said. “I’m myself
in flesh and blood; just come in the train. Get off that
range before you break it down with your three hundred
pounds of fat. Put in more kindlings and a little kerosene
if you want the fire to burn quick.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“De Lord be praised! I thought you was a spook,”
Phyllis exclaimed, as she extricated herself from the range
and sank panting into a chair with a shaving or two and
some splinters of dry wood adhering to her dress.</p>

<p class='c014'>Throwing off her bonnet and shawl Norah began to
make the fire, which was soon crackling and blazing and
diffusing a genial warmth through the chilly room, while
Phyllis told the story of their troubles.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“Miss Fanny done gone an’ married Col. Errin’ton,
an’ Mas’r Jack mighty bad in ole Mas’r’s room, an’ Miss
Annie bad upstairs, an’ company in de house, an’ herself
so oversot an’ ’scouraged that she didn’t know enough
to make a fire or get breakfast either.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As she talked the tears rolled down her face, and her
hands shook as they rested on her lap.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You poor old soul!” Norah said, in a tone she had
never before used towards Phyllis, who now broke down
entirely, while Norah tried to comfort her. “You’re
tired out; that’s the upshot of the matter,” she said.
“Just sit still where you are, and I’ll get breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As she talked she picked up broom and brush and pails
and kettles and skillets and spiders, and put them in their
places, and then moved from the pantry to the range, and
from the range back to the pantry, with the bustling activity
of old, while Phyllis sat and watched her, crying softly,
but never offering even a suggestion. The sceptre had
passed from her hands, and she was so tired and worn and
felt so keenly the trouble which had come upon them
that it was a relief to have Norah take her place. The
coffee was steaming, the muffins baking, the steak broiling
when Katy appeared, almost as startled as Phyllis
had been at the apparition of Norah tossing with a fork
the potato she was warming in cream.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Norah! What good angel sent you here just when
we need you most?” Katy cried, as she seized Norah
around the waist, feeling all care and responsibility drop
from her, now that Norah was there.</p>

<p class='c014'>Explanations followed on both sides, Norah telling how
she happened to be there and Katy corroborating the story
of Fanny’s marriage with Col. Errington. For a moment
Norah’s shoes creaked threateningly as she tramped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>across the floor, kicking a gourd out of her way and dropping
into the vernacular, as she always did when excited.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Drat the villain,” she said. “An’ sure the Lord
will reward him, and her, too; and what’s his sister afther
down here?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy told why she was there, adding that no one could
be more indignant than Miss Errington at her brother’s
conduct. Thus mollified Norah stepped more lightly,
and at Katy’s suggestion kindled a fire in Annie’s room so
noiselessly that the girl did not awaken until just before
Norah came with her breakfast. Like Katy, Annie felt
the burden of anxiety with regard to the domestic arrangements
slipping from her at sight of Norah. With her at
the helm there could be no jars except as they came
through Phyllis. But she was glad to abdicate in favor
of a younger and stronger person, and received in silence
Norah’s rasping remarks which had to come with regard
to the filth which had accumulated in the kitchen and
which nothing would eradicate but strong lye and paint.
This would fail to obliterate the marks of pot black and
grease upon the cooking-table. Nothing but a carpenter’s
plane could do that.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a few days Phyllis submitted to the inconvenience
of wading a good share of the time through the soap suds
with which Norah was inundating the floor, and then, one
morning, before anyone was astir, she quietly removed
her special belongings to the cabin she had quitted so regretfully,
and where in the wide fireplace she again kindled
her fire upon the hearth, hung her kettles on the
crane, and roasted her potatoes in the ashes. At her
next class-meeting when she told her experience she recounted
among her other <em>massies</em> that “De Lord had
fotched her as he did de chillun of Israel through de sea
and landed her in a dry place whar no water was!”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.—Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>JACK.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The doctor could not tell at first how ill Jack really
was. He had taken a severe cold and his temperature
was very high, but his paroxysms of delirium were the
worst features in the case, as they made him at times
almost uncontrollable. Apparently he was always trying
to recall something in the past which baffled his memory.
Again, he would declare his intention to go to The
Plateau. It was no place for him at The Elms, he said,
and he was going away. At such times it required all
the tact and sometimes all the strength of the neighbor
who was with him to keep him in bed. This man who
had only come for a day or two, finally signified his intention
to leave, and another must be found to take his place.
In great perplexity of mind as to where to find the proper
person, the doctor was riding slowly past Sam Slayton’s
grocery, near the door of which a knot of idlers was as
usual assembled. Reining in his horse he asked if they knew
of any able-bodied man willing to undertake the task of
nursing Mr. Fullerton, or rather of keeping him in bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is not dangerously sick,” he said, “but the
trouble has upset his brain and by spells he is crazy as a
loon and bound to get up. Some day he will scare the
women folks to death rushing into their midst, quite <i><span lang="fr">au
naturel</span></i> you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The doctor knew a little French and was fond of airing
it occasionally. His hearers understood him, however,
but no one spoke until Sam, who had been revolving the
question, said, “I have had some experience in nussin’.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>After I got that bullet in me at Gettysburg I was sent to
the con-<em>val</em>-escent hospital. When I got better I was detailed
to wait on some of the sick soldiers, who said I
done tip-top; most as well, in fact, as the young gals who
used to come in every day and insist on doing something,
if it was only to wash our faces. I’ll bet some of us had
’em washed a dozen times a day by as many different
gals, God bless ’em. Wall, as I was sayin’, I’ll go and
see what I can do with the Cap’n, just to spite that cuss
of a Colonel.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you leave your business?” the doctor asked, feeling
that this strong man, who had something mesmeric
and masterful about him, was just the one he wanted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wall, you see,” Sam replied with a laugh, “my business
ain’t no great, though it picked up a little yesterday
and to-day. I can leave it for a spell, I guess. Or mabby
these chaps’ll run it for me; I can trust ’em.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Sam’s nature to trust everybody, and three or
four at once volunteered to see to his grocery, “And
we’ll build you up a good business, too, and not steal
more than half the plunder,” they said. As a result of
this Sam left his grocery in charge of his friends, with
the injunction that old Miss Bower, who lost four boys
in the war, should have good measure, and a cent a pound
less for her groceries than the usual price, and that old
man Coulter, who lost both his legs at Antietam was to
have his tobacco free, if he didn’t call for it too often and
in too large quantities. The three who received these
and similar orders looked wonderingly at each other,
thinking they were just beginning to know how big and
generous a heart there was in this great, awkward fellow,
who was installed in Jack’s sick-room late on Thanksgiving night.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>The day had been a sad one at The Elms. With her
New England ideas and habits Norah had declared there
should be at least a cracker pudding and a chicken pie; it
wouldn’t be worth while to give thanks without as much
as that. So, between her efforts at cleaning and scrubbing
the floor and planing the cooking-table, she managed
these delicacies; but the turkey, to whom so many
promises of decapitation had been made by Phyllis remained
in his coop, waiting for a future day when the appetites
of the family would be better than they were now.</p>

<p class='c014'>Paul was the only one who enjoyed the dinner. The
others were thinking sadly how changed was the day from
what they had anticipated. Miss Errington was especially
quiet and somber, with the same look on her face
which it had worn since her brother said to her, “I am
to marry Fanny Hathern.” She had gone out that morning
after breakfast, and enquiring her way to the telegraph
office had sent a cablegram to her brother’s address
in London. It was directed to Fanny, and read: “The
Elms. Thanksgiving morning. To Mrs. G. W. Errington.
Mr. Fullerton is here, and dangerously ill with
brain fever. Recovery doubtful. C. Errington.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She knew that she possibly stretched a point in saying
“Recovery doubtful,” although she tried to persuade
herself that she did not. A man as strong and fullblooded
as Mr. Fullerton was apt to die when smitten with
fever, she reasoned, and she experienced a kind of pleasure
in thinking how this first news from home would
affect her brother’s wife. “She deserves it, and worse,”
she reflected, as she walked back to The Elms, where she
found Annie down stairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I could not stay in bed any longer,” she said, “and
I wanted to see Jack.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>He was lying very quiet and seemed to be asleep when
she went in and sat down beside him. But he soon grew
restless, and his eyes, bright with fever, fixed themselves
curiously upon her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Annie-mother,” he said, reaching out his hand and
taking hers in it, “I am glad you have come. You
almost make me know what I am trying to remember and
can’t. Was it the house on The Plateau, and is Norah up
there? I am sure I have heard her voice, and another
strange one. The house must be full of people. Send
them away. They mustn’t know what it is I can’t recall.”
After that his mind began to wander on other
subjects,—mostly debts, which he said he must see to.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What debts?” Annie asked, but he only replied,
“They make my head ache so. I was never in debt before.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think it was for furnishing his house,” Annie said
in a whisper to Miss Errington, who had stepped to the
room for the first time.</p>

<p class='c014'>Jack saw her and his eyes glared wildly as, clutching
Annie’s hand, he whispered, “Who is that tall woman?
Where have I seen her? Looks like a general in petticoats,
and, oh-h, Annie, she is like <em>him</em>; send her away.”</p>

<p class='c014'>If Miss Errington were a general in petticoats she was
not one to retreat at the first gun fired at her, and going
up to Jack she laid her hand on his forehead, and said in
her decided, straight forward way, “I am his sister,
but your friend and Annie’s. I have come to help her
and you. You will let me stay, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>His lip quivered, but he did not answer, nor did he try
to withdraw from the touch of her soothing hand. She
had conquered him, and she sat by him a long time, asking
him once, when he began to rave about his debts, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>much they were and where they were. Very curtly he
told her it was none of her business, adding that she
might find out if she could.</p>

<p class='c014'>That night Sam Slayton came in his best clothes, plaid
vest and red tie, looking the typical Brother Jonathan,
as he said to Jack, “Wall, how are you, Cap’n? Goin’
to pull through, ain’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pull through what? and who are you?” Jack asked,
adding quickly, “Oh, I know; you’re that Yankee grocer.
Pretty good sort of a fellow they say.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thank you, Square,” Sam replied; after that, calling
him alternately the Cap’n and the Square, as the fancy
took him.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the first there was amity between the two. Sam
was so original and good-natured, with so quaint a way of
putting things that the humor of it penetrated Jack’s
clouded brain, and more than once, as the evening wore
on, he laughed heartily at something Sam said to him.
The next day there came a trial of strength, Jack declaring
he would get up and go and pay his debts, and Sam telling
him he could not. Laying his arm, big as a sledge hammer,
across Jack’s chest he kept him down until he became
perfectly quiet and said, with a laugh, “Licked
again; that was always the way in the war; just as we
thought we’d got the upper hand there came along the
lines the rumor they are coming, they are coming,
300,000 more, and, by George, they did come, and when
we shot down one, ten took his place. You were like the
bear the old Vikings used to boil and eat in the morning
in the hall of Valhalla, and which at night was alive and
peart as ever and ready to be boiled again. Heard of
him, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Sam didn’t quite think he had, but he knew “We are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>coming, Father Abram, three hundred thousand more,”
and could sing it, too; should he?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, go it,” Jack said, and immediately Sam began
the famous war song.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We are coming, Father Abram,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Three hundred thousand more,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the mountains of New England</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To the California shore.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Sam had a rich, full voice, with a note of pathos in it,
which made one forget its slightly nasal twang, and not
only Jack but the ladies in the adjoining room listened
breathlessly until the song was ended.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s tip-top,” Jack said. “Made me forget what
I am trying to remember. Give us another. ‘Three
cheers for General Lee and the Southern Army, oh.’
Know it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Sam nodded and began again, singing this time with so
much feeling that either because of the music, or because it
awakened in his misty brain a regret for the Lost Cause the
tears gathered in his eyes and rolled down Jack’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know why I am crying,” he said apologetically,
“unless it’s for what I can’t remember, or for the
boys dead on so many battlefields, and we went into it so
bravely and hopefully, like Sennacherib’s army.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who’s he? I never heard of that general, and I
thought I knew ’em all,” Sam asked, and Jack replied,
“Have you never heard of the one hundred and eighty-five
thousand able-bodied men who encamped for the night
and got up in the morning all dead corpses?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jerusalem! You don’t say! That beats all. It must
have happened when I was in Libby. How could they get
up if they was dead corpses. I can’t b’lieve it. That’s
one of your rebel yarns,” Sam said.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Bible truth,” Jack rejoined, with a twinkle in his eyes
as if he were enjoying Sam’s discomfiture. “Now give us
something jolly, like Dixie,” he continued, “or that one
about John Brown’s body. I used to hear you fellows
sing it nights when our lines were near each other.
Know it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’d laugh if I didn’t. I know the whole caboodle,
both sides,” Sam said, and for an hour or more the
house rang with the old war melodies,—“Dixie,” “Marching
through Georgia,” “My Maryland,” and “John
Brown’s Body,” which last Sam sang with great gusto,
especially the part relating to the apple tree.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was the last, and Jack, who had listened to all
which had gone before with lively interest began to grow
excited, while his face clouded and his eyes were full of
pain.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stop that,” he thundered, when the leader of the
Southern Confederacy was threatened with suspension.
“No more of that. It brings back what I have been trying
to remember,—<em>her</em>. If she were here, she’d hang <em>you</em>
to the sour apple tree; oh, Fanny, Fanny.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a bitter cry, like that at The Plateau when the
shock first came upon him. As he had cried then, so he
did now, with great, choking sobs, which brought Miss
Errington and Annie and Katy all to his bedside. For a
few minutes he was perfectly conscious and whispered
amid his sobs, “It isn’t manly, I know, but I can’t help
it, my head aches so, and I am so weak. Oh, Fanny, how
could you do it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Annie who succeeded in quieting him, and he at
last fell asleep with one of her hands holding his and the
other upon his forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Little Annie-mother, what should I do without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>you?” he said, with a pitiful kind of smile as he looked at
her through his tears and then closed his eyes wearily.</p>

<p class='c014'>After this there were no more paroxysms of delirium,
and he seemed partially conscious of what was passing
around him. He knew Katy was there, and Miss Errington,
whom he still called the general in petticoats. Every
day, and many times a day, Sam sung the war songs,
with every negro melody he could recall. John Brown,
however, was allowed to moulder quietly in the ground,
and was never sung again. As Jack grew stronger he
clung more and more to Annie, who always sat with him
when Sam went to see how matters were progressing at
the grocery, where there were three doing business for
him, and doing it well, too, judging from the returns he
found in his cash drawer. Miranda seemed a near possibility,
and Sam told Annie about her, and said he hoped
she would call and be kind of sociable when Miranda
came. He staid at The Elms a week or more, and then
as Jack was improving and perfectly sane he returned to
his business and Annie took his place as nurse. Fanny’s
name Jack never mentioned, but one day, when he
had lain a long time with his eyes closed and an expression
on his face as if he were intently thinking, he said to
Annie suddenly, “Have you heard from—from them?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” Annie replied. “A cablegram came from
Queenstown. They were safely across, but Fan had been
very sick most of the voyage, which was a rough one.
There has also been another from London. It read,
‘How is Jack?’ and was signed ‘Fanny.’ Miss Errington
had cabled her that you were very ill.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment Jack was silent and then said, “There
was a note for me which I didn’t read. Do you know
what became of it?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“Yes, I have it,” Annie replied, and going to her room
she returned with it and the hundred dollar bill Fanny had
sent in her letter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Taking the note Jack read it with a white face and hard
eyes in which there was no sign of softening. The bitterness
of death was over, and he could read with comparative
calmness what at first would have wrung his heart with
anguish. There was nothing flippant in it, as there had
been in the letter to Annie. There were self-accusations
and assertions that, after what she had seen of the world,
she could not endure poverty and the dull life of Lovering.
If Jack were rich she should prefer him to any man in the
world, she said, and she believed she did prefer him now,
notwithstanding what she had done.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have always loved you,” she wrote in conclusion,
“and I meant to be true, but a stronger will than my own
has mastered me. Don’t despise and forget me. I
couldn’t bear that, and if I am ever very unhappy there
will be a comfort in knowing that you love me still. Forgive
me, and think of me as I used to be in the old days
which seem so far away. Good-bye.</p>
<div class='c019'><span class='sc'>Fan.</span>”</div>

<p class='c014'>As he read this part of the letter Jack’s breath came
in gasps, for he understood the selfishness of the girl
who, while not hesitating to break his heart, still wished
to retain his love and keep him loyal to her. Tearing the
note in shreds he handed them to Annie, and said, “Put
them in the fire.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Raising himself on his elbow he watched them as they
crisped and darkened and disappeared in smoke. Then,
as if with them the past had been blotted out, he lay down
again with a different look upon his face from any Annie
had seen there since the day at The Plateau. His love
for Fanny was dying, and the last blow had been given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>by her note with which she had meant to bind him to her,
in memory, at least.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jack,” Annie said, after a moment. “Fan sent this
to you in payment for Black Beauty. She wants him
back,” and she handed him the hundred dollar note.</p>

<p class='c014'>She had seen him angry before, but was not prepared
for the burst of passion which followed. Throwing the
bill from him he exclaimed, “She is welcome to Black
Beauty, and I will have none of <em>his</em> money. Take it
away before I tear it up as I did her note.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was in vain that Annie tried to explain and urge him
to keep it, reminding him of the debts he must have incurred
in furnishing his house and which this would help
to pay. He would not listen. He had borrowed money,
he said, with which to pay his bills, preferring to have one
debt rather than many. This was due and the bill had
perhaps been sent to him during his illness, but he would
never soil his hands with any part of the money which
had bought his promised wife.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Use it yourself. I give it to you, or Paul, or Katy,
as you please,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>In her heart Annie respected him for his decision and
put the bill away till she could confer with Miss Errington
with regard to it. That lady, who, her brother said,
was never happier than when bossing some thing or some
body, was carrying matters with a high hand at The Elms
and managing generally. The bill of which Jack had
spoken had been brought to the house for collection, and
the man who held the note and who lived in Petersburg
had said he had great need of the money, but supposed
he must wait until Mr. Fullerton was better. It chanced
that Miss Errington saw him, as Annie was with Jack and
Katy was out. For a moment she reflected, wondering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>if she dare do it. Then deciding that it was no more than
what she owed Mr. Fullerton for the wrong he had received
from her brother, she paid the debt and closed
the transaction. This Annie told Jack when he spoke of
his bill in Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe she wishes to give it to you as a kind of
atonement for what her brother has done. She has plenty
of money,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>Give</em> it to me!” Jack repeated angrily. “Does she
think me a pauper? and as to <em>atonement</em>, nothing can atone,—certainly
not money.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He spoke bitterly, and rising from his chair, for he was
now able to be up, walked to the window, where he stood
looking out upon the dreary landscape with a face sad and
stern.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Talking of <em>pay</em>,” he said, turning suddenly to Annie,
“I can never repay <em>you</em> for all you have been to me in the
darkest hours of my life, and the trouble and care I have
brought to you. But I shall never forget it. As soon as
I am able I am going away from Lovering for awhile. I
cannot be here on Christmas day. When I come back I
shall be the same old Jack you used to know, with the
past buried so deep that it will never be unearthed. I
shall do nothing with the house at present. I cannot
even go into it, but shall leave it in your care and
Norah’s. I think I shall go to Florida into the sunshine.
I have not felt warm since that day at The Plateau. No
matter how high my fever ran I was conscious of a cold
lump like ice at my heart which nothing could melt.
Sometimes when you put your hand on my forehead and
when you thought I was asleep and said ‘Poor Jack,’ it
melted a little. God bless you, Annie. You were to
have been my sister. I hold you my sister still,—the best
a man ever had.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>He laid his hand caressingly upon her head as she stood
by him, a little drooping figure, wholly unlike the queenly
Fanny in her <i><span lang="de">personelle</span></i>, but so much truer and nobler in
every womanly instinct.</p>

<p class='c014'>Within a week after this conversation Jack left Lovering
for Florida, under whose sunny skies he hoped to recuperate
both in mind and body. Before going he had
a long interview with Miss Errington, of whom he had
seen but little, and for whom he had a natural prejudice.
This, however, wore away as he talked with her. She
might be meddlesome and dictatorial, and was never happier
than when attending to some one’s business, but she
was so thoroughly good and kind and so sincere in her
desire to help one out of difficulties that few could withstand
her, and Jack was not one of the few. Pay her he
must, but he consented at last to be her debtor for a time
and to borrow more of her if necessary.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is a noble woman and I am glad you have her for
a friend,” he said to Annie, when the interview was over.
“She must have some of her brother’s magnetic power to
twist me round her fingers as she did. You can’t do better
than to be guided by her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>One thing, however, she could not persuade Jack to
do, and that was to go into the house at The Plateau.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No!” he said decidedly, when she urged that there
must be a first time, and it was better to do a disagreeable
thing at once, and be done with it. “I cannot go
there now. It would be like looking into my coffin.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He would not even ride past it when Annie took him
out to drive behind Black Beauty. Too many hopes of
happiness were strangled there. “It is a haunted place
to me. Later on, when I come back, I will go through it
with you and see if the ghosts are there still,” he said,
when she suggested driving that way.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Everything pertaining to the grounds and out-buildings
was left in the care of Sam Slayton, who, having won
golden laurels in his nursing, was earning golden dollars
in his grocery, which had become very popular and, as
Sam said, was patronized by all the <em>e-lity</em> in town. Annie
was to have the keys of the house and to see that it was
kept in order. Nothing was to be changed; nothing removed.
At this point Miss Errington interfered. It was
a shame, she said, to let a fine new Steinway be ruined by
standing unused in a cold house all winter. Far better
negotiate for its return, even at a discount on the price.</p>

<p class='c014'>The plan commended itself to Jack as sensible, and
the instrument, on which no one had ever played, was
returned to the firm from which it came and the greater
portion of the money paid for it refunded. It was nearly
Christmas time when Jack at last left Lovering, broken
in health and spirits, but with a rebound in his sunny,
genial nature, which promised much for him when time
and change had healed the wound, which smarted with a
fresh pain when he bade good-bye to his friends at The
Elms, and especially to Annie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know what I shall do without my little Annie-mother,”
he said, with a quiver in his voice as he stooped
and kissed her forehead as reverently as if she had really
been his mother instead of a shrinking girl whose heart
throbbed with rapture for a moment, and then beat with
a heavy pain at this first kiss she had ever received from
Jack since he was a boy and they played the old-time
games where kissing was a conspicuous feature and counted
for nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The day after Jack left, Annie received a letter from
Fanny written at Morley’s Hotel in London, where they
were stopping. It was not very long, and to Annie, who
knew her sister so well, it did not seem at all in Fanny’s
usual bright, witty vein, but rather as if written under
restraint. She had been horribly seasick, she said, and
if possible would rather walk home than cross the ocean
again in rough weather. She had pleasant rooms at the
hotel looking out on Trafalgar Square, and was enjoying
the sights of London as much as she could in the fog and
rain. The Colonel had met several acquaintances at the
hotel and more outside, and she had attended a grand
dinner in an English family and worn a lovely dress bought
at Peter Robinson’s, but made in Paris. The people of the
house had been very attentive to her, and had told her
that her accent was more English than American. The
next night she was going to hear Patti in full evening
dress, also bought at Peter Robinson’s. After a few days
they were to leave London for Paris, where they should
stay until her wardrobe was complete, when they would
go on to Nice and Monte Carlo, and then to Italy, spending
the winter either in Florence or Rome, probably the
latter. There were messages of love for Katy and Paul
and Phyllis, but no allusion was made to Jack, or mention
of her husband, except when she spoke of his acquaintances.
She was anxious for a letter from Annie, telling
her all the news, and she signed herself “Fanny.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Written with a lead pencil between the lines on the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>page, and so fine that they were scarcely legible, were the
words, “Oh, Annie, what would I give to see you and
Katy and Paul and the old home just for a minute! Write
me often and <em>everything</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The letter was directed in the Colonel’s handwriting, and
his sister had no doubt that his eye had seen all that was
in it, except the pencil lines inserted in a sentence with
which they had no connection. There was a world of
homesickness in the cry, and Miss Errington read the
meaning plainer than Annie did, feeling sure that her
brother had already begun to bend his young wife to his
iron will.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor girl! I pity her,” she thought, as she gave the
letter back to Annie. “I shall write to your sister to-day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie had written ten or twelve days before, and her
letter and Fanny’s had probably crossed each other. She
had said nothing of the scene at The Plateau when Jack
first heard the news. “What is done cannot be undone,
and there is no need to try and make her wretched,” she
reasoned. So she merely spoke of Jack’s sudden illness,
saying he was at The Elms and gaining slowly. Then she
tried to write naturally about Katy and Paul and Phyllis
and the townspeople, and whatever else she thought
would interest her sister. At the close she said, “Oh,
Fan, you don’t know how I miss you everywhere. When
you were away with Miss Errington it was not so bad, for
I thought you were coming back. Now I know you are
not, and I seem to have lost half of myself and am constantly
looking for it. I hope you will be happy. You
always wished to go to Europe, and I think you will enjoy
all you are seeing. Katy sends love and Paul a kiss to
‘Fan-er-nan.’ He was delighted with his horse. Lovingly,
Ann.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Three days before Christmas there came to The Elms an
express package directed to Fanny. In it were two boxes
bearing the name of a New York firm. One contained a
dozen after-dinner coffees of fine Dresden china; the other
a dozen silver forks and four dozen spoons of different
sizes, and a dozen pearl handled knives, Carl’s wedding
present to Fanny. They were very beautiful, but it
seemed to Annie like opening two coffins, and her tears
came near staining the satin lining of the boxes as she bent
over them and thought how Fanny’s eyes would have
sparkled had she been there to see them. The same train
which brought the package brought also a letter from Carl
written from The Windsor in New York, where he had
been staying for two or three weeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I got tired of loafing in Boston,” he wrote, “and I
thought I would try New York, and, by George, I am tired
of that. I must do something or die of <i><span lang="fr">ennui</span></i>. Coming to the
wedding will be a little diversion, and after that I shall
either open a corner grocery or go abroad. I have not decided
which. I envy Jack and Fanny being settled and done
for. Wish I were. I have selected at Tiffany’s a wedding
present, which I think Fan will like. I told them to engrave
the silver ‘<em>F. H.</em>’ and the stupid rascals have left
off the ‘<em>F.</em>,’ and marked them simply ‘<em>H.</em>’ I expect to
be with you the 23rd, if nothing happens. Very truly,
<span class='sc'>Carl</span>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a good deal of Carl in this letter, and Katy’s
eyes grew very bright for a moment, as Annie read it, and
then took on a cold expression, which Miss Errington, who
was watching her, could not quite understand. Annie had
written to Carl in Boston, telling him there was to be no
wedding, but asking him to spend Christmas with them just
the same. This letter he evidently had not received. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>was coming, and they were all glad, and none more so
than Norah. With all his faults there was not a better
man living than Carl, she said, and her face was radiant
as she prepared his favorite dishes. If they couldn’t have
a wedding-feast they should have a dinner that <em>was</em> a dinner,
with eight or ten courses, and in the exuberance of
her joy she allowed Phyllis to stone the raisins for the pudding
she was going to send to the table over a blue flame of-alcohol.
Carl’s own room was made ready for him, and
every time he heard the whistle of a Richmond train Paul
stationed himself at the window to watch for the village
’bus which was to bring his brother from the station. But
the trains came and went and brought neither Carl nor any
tidings of him, and every one gave him up but Norah.
She had more faith in him than anyone else, although
admitting that he was never of the same mind two hours
at a time.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But he’s comin’ now. I feel it in my bones,” she said,
and made her preparations for Christmas with as much
certainty of his presence as if he were already there.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a dreary Christmas Eve, with dark clouds scudding
across the starless sky and the wind roaring through
the tall trees which skirted the avenue leading from the
highway to the house, and the morning was drearier still.
There had been a blizzard on the western prairies, and it
was spending itself on this part of Virginia in a cold,
steady rain, which drove against the windows and found its
way under the door into the hall, where it stood in little
puddles until Phyllis swept it out, letting in more rain as
she did so, and shivering with cold as she closed the door
and went into the dining-room where breakfast was upon
the table and where Paul’s was the only happy face. He
had found his stockings full of gifts from Santa Claus, balls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>and carts and tops and horns, the last of which he blew
vigorously as Phyllis lifted him into his high chair and
fastened on his bib. Annie was pouring the coffee when
Phyllis suddenly exclaimed, “Praise de Lord, thar’s Mas’r
Carl now on de step with his umberill blown t’other side
out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He did not stop to knock, but sprang into the hall, with
the rain dripping from his Mackintosh and hat, and his
umbrella a total wreck.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hallo, Hallo, Hallo, all of you,” he said, as Annie and
Katy and Phyllis rushed into the hall to meet him. “This
is a nice go for Christmas and a wedding. Call <em>this</em> the
sunny south? I am frozen to my bones,” he continued,
as he divested himself of his wet garments. “Don’t ask
me any questions until I get near a fire and that coffee,
which smells so deliciously. I haven’t had a decent thing
to eat since I left New York and am half famished.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was soon by the open fire in the dining-room and
drinking the hot coffee which Annie poured for him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I meant to be here yesterday afternoon,” he said, “but
was too late for the train; so I came on at night in a
cross between a lumber wagon and a cattle car. Never
slept a wink, but I was bound to get here if I walked.
What time is the ceremony, and where is Fan?” he asked.
“Is she staying in her room until she bursts upon us in
all her bridal splendor?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked at Annie, who replied, “You didn’t get my
letter?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No. What letter? I have been in New York three
weeks, and when I left Boston I didn’t know how long I
should be gone, and gave no directions to have my mail
sent to me. My correspondence is not very important
anyway, and I hate to answer letters. What did you write,
and where <em>is</em> Fan?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>He asked the question a little anxiously, for something
in the faces at the table surprised him. It was Paul who
answered. With a toot upon his horn and his mouth full of
buttered muffins he said, “Fan-er-nan is mar-yed and
gone to Europe.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Married and gone to Europe!” Carl repeated. “What
do you mean? Married to whom?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“To my brother,” Miss Errington said, taking upon
herself the task of explaining, which she did very briefly
and without comment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Great guns!” Carl exclaimed. “I would not have
believed that of Fan. And so there is to be no wedding
after all. That’s too bad, and I nearly breaking my neck
to get here,” he continued, as he rose from the table and
began to walk the floor, talking rapidly and asking many
questions which no one answered. “I tell you what,”
he said suddenly, going up to Katy, who stood by the
window looking out into the rain, “it is too bad to come
all this distance without a wedding. We’ll have one yet,
if you say so. I’ll put on my other coat and you your
other gown. We’ll send for the minister, and, presto! it’s
done! What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a grey light in Katy’s eyes and a ring in
her voice, although she tried to laugh, as she replied,
“Thank you! I’m not in so great a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a good deal of dignity in her manner, and her
head was held high as she stepped back from him and
walked into the adjoining room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“By Jove! Something is up,” Carl said under his
breath. He was so accustomed to have every girl respond
to his call that when he met with a rebuff it surprised him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy had been so soft and yielding and so like wax in
his hands when he was there before that he did not know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>what to make of her now. She would thaw of course.
She must, for of all the girls he had ever met Katy had
made the strongest impression upon him, and was the one
he liked best. Away from her he could forget her in a
measure, but with her again her spell was upon him, intensified
by her coolness, and if she had said so, he would
have probably sent for the minister, donned his other coat
and settled the matter forever. But she didn’t say so, and
her manner piqued and puzzled him. She was very gracious
to him, however, when he joined her in the parlor
after a romp with Paul, and there was a look in her eyes
which made him think of the green woods and the mossy
banks where he had sat and talked with her the year before,
and watched the color deepening on her cheeks, and
the coy drooping of her eyelids, as he held her hand in
his, or pushed back a stray curl of her hair from her face,
or put his arm around her when there was no other support
for her back. Katy had thought of this, too, and hated
herself for the part she had played in what was more a
tragedy, for her, than a comedy to be lightly forgotten.
Not for worlds, however, would she let him know that she
had given more meaning to that summer idyl than he had
done, and after her first show of coldness she was herself
again, and laughed and chatted with him as merrily as ever.</p>

<p class='c014'>At his request she sang for him, and sang, it seemed to
her, as she had never sung before. He was not at all a
critic, or music mad in any sense, but he listened in wonder
as her rich, full voice filled the house and made him
feel hot and cold and faint all at the same time.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, Katy!” he exclaimed, when she was through.
“You take a fellow right off his feet. Why don’t you go upon
the stage? The whole world would ring with your name.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am going,” Katy replied, as she put up her music,
and rose from the stool.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“Never!” Carl exclaimed, so emphatically that Katy
looked at him in wonder.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What have you against the stage?” she asked, and
he replied, “Nothing against those who are already there,
and among whom, I dare say, there are as many good
people in proportion as there are off; but everything
against it for you, and when I said you ought to be there
I was merely in fun. Standing before the people to be
criticised and talked about by the men in the clubs and
public places is bad enough, but when you get behind the
scenes and see the freedom which must necessarily exist
there, and when you come in contact with all classes of men
who, because of their talent for acting, or singing, or both,
form a part of every company, and with whom you have
no choice except to play, <em>Bah!</em> I believe I’d rather see
you dead than there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was worse than Fanny, and Katy felt some of her
castles melting into air as he talked, for all the fame she
had sometimes dreamed of winning was not worth the loss
of Carl’s good opinion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perfect yourself in music,” he continued, “and sing
for your friends; sing in church; sing for charities; sing
anywhere except with a troupe. I couldn’t bear that.
Better send for the minister now. It isn’t too late. What
do you say?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was standing with his hand on her shoulder, looking
at her, while she returned his gaze unflinchingly as she
replied, “Just what I said this morning. No, thank you.
I am not in so great a hurry; and if I were, it would be
the mistake of my life and yours. What you do to-day
you forget or regret to-morrow, and I have my career to
consider.”</p>

<p class='c014'>If Carl had been in the habit of swearing he would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>consigned her <em>career</em> to the lower regions, and in his excitement
he might have done so now if she had not released
herself from him, and swept from the room, leaving him
discomfited and uncertain as to whether he had actually
proposed and been rejected, and if it were true that what
he desired to-day he tired of to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c014'>“By Jove!” he said to himself. “No girl ever flouted
me like that. I know of forty, with their mothers at their
backs, who would have gone for the parson themselves and
had him here by this time. I guess Virginia girls are different
from those of Boston; Katy certainly is. <em>Career!</em>
Katy on the stage! Katy in tights,—with glasses leveled at
her! It might come to that sometime, if she sang in opera.
I believe I’d shoot her, or myself, should I live to see the
sight. That is Miss Errington’s work, but I won’t have
it, and I’ll propose in <i><span lang="la">bona fide</span></i> shape and have the thing
settled. Katy is too young, perhaps. She can’t be seventeen
yet, but I’ll wait three years. There’s a lot of things
I want to do before I settle down into a steady-going
married man. But I’ll bind Katy and fix that stage business.
I wonder if I would get tired of a three years’ engagement.”
On the whole, he concluded that he would,
and as he was not quite ready to marry, he decided
to wait awhile and keep his eyes on Katy until he saw
dangerous signs of her <em>career</em>, when he would step in and
stop it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl was a curious compound. There was no question
that he loved Katy, but he loved his freedom better, and,
on the whole, he was glad that after his talk with her of
the stage she gave him no chance to see her alone. If she
had, her grace and sweetness and beauty would have influenced
him so strongly that he might have proposed in
earnest, and—“been rejected, I believe upon my soul,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>he reflected, while thinking the matter over after his
return to Boston.</p>

<p class='c014'>Before leaving he had a long talk with Annie with regard
to Paul, for whom he had conceived a great liking,
and whom he began to think he had neglected. To
this thought he was helped by Norah, who, when he asked
how long she intended staying at The Elms replied, that
she didn’t know. Probably not long, as she knew Miss
Annie could not afford to keep her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t think her father left much for his daughters,”
she said, “and there is Paul to be taken care of, or he may
be a cripple. Have you ever thought of that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He had not, and he didn’t know what she meant. Accustomed
all his life to every luxury, he had not given
much thought to the wants of others, except as they were
presented to him. When asked for a subscription to some
charity, as he often was, he gave liberally. When he
passed an old half-clothed man or woman on the corner
turning a hand-organ, with “I am blind” pinned on the
breast, he always dropped a coin into the cup, and would
have lavished thousands upon the people of The Elms had
it been suggested to him that they needed it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t believe I am so selfish a cad as I am thoughtless,”
he said to Annie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You see, I have more than I ought to have, and I have
given myself to spending it, and forgotten that something
was due to others besides charities,—to Paul for instance.
He is my half-brother, as well as yours, and I ought
never to have let the whole burden fall on you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It has been no burden,” Annie interposed quickly.
“Paul could never be that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t mean it that way,” Carl answered. “I mean
that I ought to help, and I’m going to. I shall provide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>for his education and settle something upon him at once.
And what is this Norah has been telling me about his
being a cripple? She talked as if I were a brute.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the excitement incident upon Fanny’s marriage,
Annie had for the time being forgotten the fear which had
haunted her with regard to Paul, and which came back to
her with a shock when Carl asked about it. She told him all
she knew, saying, however, that she hoped her fears were
groundless, Paul seemed so active and well. Carl’s
answer was not reassuring.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have noticed him limping at times,” he said, “and
once when I asked him why he did so he replied, ‘It hurts
me here,’ and put his hand on his back. He must have
the best medical advice in Richmond, and if that does
not answer we must take him to New York, and if that
fails, I will take him to Paris. He can be cured there.
Don’t look so white and scared. There may be nothing
serious, and if there is, it can be cured. Suppose you
go to Richmond with me and take Paul.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was on Sunday, and the next day Carl left The
Elms, and Annie and Paul went with him as far as Richmond,—the
little boy delighted with the first journey he
had ever taken in the cars, and Annie’s heart full of
anxiety as to what the doctor’s verdict might be.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>
  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.—Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>ON THE CELTIC.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Everything which ingenuity could devise or money
buy had been bought and devised for the two staterooms
which Col. Errington had engaged upon the Celtic, and
between which there was only a narrow passage. In the
one which the Colonel called Fanny’s boudoir, and where
she was to sit when it was too cold to be on deck and
she did not care to stay in the saloon, there was a large
easy chair and footstool, with soft cushions and pillows
on the couch under the window. There was a basket of
champagne in one corner, with jars of French prunes, preserved
ginger and Albert biscuits in another. There were
all the last magazines, with three or four books on the
shelves, and on the washstand a basket of exquisite flowers
filling the room with perfume. When they came on
board the ship the Colonel had only shown Fanny their
sleeping-room and had then hurried her to the deck,
where they staid until the ship was moving down the bay,
across which the November wind blew cold and chill.
“Now come and see your parlor,” he said, taking her by
the arm and leading her to No. ——.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Fanny’s first knowledge of a steamer, but she
readily understood how infinitely superior this stateroom
was to the others, and that she was indebted to her husband’s
forethought for it. In the excitement of her hasty
marriage there had been no chance for love-making, and
her heart was too sore and full of Jack to think of much
else. She heard his voice in the din around her as the
passengers and their friends crowded the deck, and saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>his face on the wharf, waving her a good-bye as the ship
moved away and the objects began to grow dim in the distance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Jack, will you never leave me!” she thought,
and her hands clasped each other tightly and the lump in
her throat was getting larger than she could master when
the Colonel broke the spell and led her to her stateroom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you like it?” he asked, sitting down upon
the couch and watching her as her eyes took in every detail
and then filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>He had asked her to call him George, but she had never
done so until now, when there awoke within her a throb of
something more than gratitude and less than love, and
going up to him she put her arms around his neck and
kissed him on his forehead. “Oh, George,” she said,
“it is lovely, and you were so kind to do it all for me. I
thank you, and—and—I am going to be so good, only I
must cry now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was sobbing like a child, and he let her cry without
protest, and held her closely to him and gently smoothed
her hair. Skilled in reading faces, he had read hers on
the deck and guessed that thoughts of home, and possibly
of Jack, were bringing the pallor around her lips, and the
wistful look of pain into her eyes. Just how much of
Jack was in her thoughts he did not know. She had told
him distinctly that she did not love him, and he had said
it was not her love he wanted. It was her beauty,—herself,—her
person. He had all these, and when she put
her arms around his neck and kissed him, calling him
George, there swept over him a possibility of what
might be in the future, and in that moment he was as near
loving her as he ever would be in his life. And because
of this love, if it could be called by that name, his jealousy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>of Jack and every man who looked at her would be
stronger and fiercer and make itself felt at every point.
When he thought she had cried enough, he told her so;
but her tears, once started, could not be easily stopped,
and she kept on until something in his voice and manner,
which she could feel but not define, checked them back;
and lifting her head from his shoulder she said, “I didn’t
mean to cry like this, but I couldn’t help it. I am thinking
of Annie and Katy and Paul.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I know; I understand perfectly of what you are
thinking, but crying will not help you. Don’t do it
again. It makes your eyes and nose red, and I want you
to look your best for dinner. I must go now and see if
the purser has secured our seats at table, as I told him to
do. Dry your eyes and let me see a bright face when I
return; or, would you prefer to go on deck and wait for
me there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She chose the latter, feeling that, pretty as the stateroom
was, she should smother in its narrow confines.
She wanted air and space in which to breathe, and strangle,
if possible, the lump in her throat, which pained her
so. Her husband brought her beautiful fur-lined cloak,
and fastened it around her neck and tied on her sea hood,
which, with its lining of quilted crimson satin was very
becoming to her. “There, you look like the pictures of
Red Riding Hood,” he said, as he passed his arm around
her to steady her, and then led her to the deck. Their
chairs were still inextricably mixed up with a pile of other
chairs, so he found her a sheltered place on the seat near
the railing, and throwing a rug across her lap left her
alone with the injunction, “Mind you don’t cry again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No-o,” she said, with a sob, like a little child trying
to keep down the tears it has been forbidden to shed.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>There were many passing and repassing around her,—passengers,
sailors and officers of the ship, each one of
whom glanced at the lovely face slightly upturned to the
cool wind which blew so refreshingly across the burning
cheeks. But Fanny saw none of them. Her eyes were
with her thoughts, and they were far away in her Virginia
home, with Jack, and every incident of her life as connected
with him. How vivid it all was to her. The tall
boy and the little girl he had carried so often on his back
to school when the mud was deep and she was afraid of
soiling her shoes and dress;—the candy and sugar hearts
and kisses with the mottoes which he had hidden under
her desk where she was sure to find them;—the big red apples
he gave her at recess, and his championship generally
when she needed it, as she frequently did,—for with
her quick hot temper she was a good deal of a fighter,
and often battled both with the girls and boys. Later on,
when he was a grown young man and she a young lady,
how tender and true he had always been to her,—loving
her with an intensity which she realized now as she had
never before. In his last letter to her, received the day
before she had decided to break his heart, he had poured
out his love like a torrent. “My darling,” he wrote
at the close, “you do not know how much I love you,
or how glad I am that I am so soon to see you. Only a
few days more and you will be here, and then in one short
month you will be mine. It makes me faint with joy to
think of it. I am not half good enough for you, but if
love and devotion can make a woman happy, you shall be
so, my darling, my queen, my wife that is to be.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She had burned the letter when she said yes to Col. Errington,
but the last sentences had stamped themselves
upon her memory and came back to her now, each one a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>stab as she sat there alone, seeing nothing, hearing nothing,
except the regular thud of the machinery, which she
knew was every moment taking her farther and farther
away from the old life and Jack. Yesterday at this time
she was free, and could have withdrawn; now, it was too
late. She was bound; she could not go back if she
would. Possibly she would not if she could, so contradictory
was her nature. A life of wealth and luxury looked
very attractive to her still, if she could only have forgotten
Jack. But she could not. His face was everywhere.
It looked at her from every wave which broke around the
boat; from every sail, and every angle on the deck where
the dark shadows were gathering as the short November
day drew to a close; not happy and buoyant as she had
always seen it, but full of anguish, as she knew it would
be when her letter reached him. “Oh, Jack, Jack!”
she said aloud, as she leaned her head back so that her
face was distinctly visible to the man who stood behind
her and whose approach she had not heard.</p>

<p class='c014'>Col. Errington had secured the seats he wanted at the
Captain’s table,—had met some New York acquaintances,
had been congratulated on his marriage, whose haste he
had explained as he did to the clergyman, and now he
had come to introduce her and take her in to dinner and
see what impression she would make upon his friends. It
was not particularly pleasant for a bridegroom of less
than twenty-four hours to hear his bride repeating the
name of his rival as Fanny repeated Jack’s, and for a moment
the Colonel clenched his fists and ground his teeth
together, muttering an oath under his breath. Then,—for
he was not all hard,—there came over him a feeling
of pity for the girl who had never pretended to love him,
and whom he had lured from her allegiance to another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>man by every art and argument of which he was
capable.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shall not stand much of this, but for once I don’t
mind,” he thought, and his voice was very pleasant as he
said to her, “Fanny, Fanny, have you been asleep?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no,” she answered quickly, starting up from her
reclining position,—her face, which had looked so pale,
flushing to the color of the crimson satin lining of her
hood; “why did you think me asleep?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You were talking aloud; better not give your thoughts
to the winds again,” he replied, rather significantly; then
added, “dinner is ready and I have come for you. Your
seat is next to the Captain, and some of my friends are at
the same table. I want to present them to you. That
hood is very becoming to you, but you’d better not wear
it to the table. Give a brush or two to your hair and
you are all right.”</p>

<p class='c014'>They were in their stateroom now and Fanny was divesting
herself of her cloak and hood and giving the few
touches to her hair which her husband had suggested.
Her gown of navy blue which Jack’s money had bought
fitted her fine figure admirably; the color had come back
to her cheeks and the sparkle to her eyes, and the Colonel
was very proud of her as he lead her into the dining-room
and presented her to the Captain and those of his friends
whose seats were near his own. Gossip on a ship spreads
rapidly, and it had been rumored about so soon that she
was the bride of the elderly man who was so attentive to
her. Also, that there was a romance of some kind connected
with the marriage, and many eyes were directed
to her as she took her seat at the table, with the Captain
on her left and her husband on her right. She knew she
was attracting attention, and her spirits began to rise as
she talked with the Captain and those near her to whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>she had been introduced. In front of her was a large
bouquet of roses, with a card attached to it bearing her
name; near it was a basket of cut flowers, also bearing
her name, both ordered by the Colonel. In her ignorance
of ship usages she fancied they might be from the Captain,
who was so attentive to her, or some other friend of
her husband’s, and she felt almost happy as she buried
her face in the lovely roses, which seemed to add a soft
sweetness to her brilliant beauty.</p>

<p class='c014'>When dinner was over she went with her husband for a
walk upon the deck until the cold drove them to the saloon,
where she was soon the center of interest to the
Colonel’s New York friends, who vied with each other in
paying her attention. Matters were not so bad after all,
and it was a pretty good thing to be the bride of a man
as rich and well known as Col. Errington. Jack and The
Elms and Annie and Katy and Paul began to grow misty
and far away from this gay company of polished city people.
But they came back to her when, at a late hour, the
party broke up and the Colonel said he must have a cigar
before retiring; but he conducted Fanny to the door of
her stateroom, and telling her he should not be gone long
left her alone with her wretched thoughts, which, as if to
make amends for the respite they had given her, came
swarming into her mind with redoubled force. The stateroom
lost its prettiness; the roaring of the sea reminded
her of the wintry wind as it sometimes howled through
the woods and around the house at home when a wild
storm was sweeping over Lovering, and, worse than all,
Jack’s eyes were looking at her again from her wedding
ring and the superb solitaire which guarded it, to the gown
his money had paid for and which she was removing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! Jack, Jack,—will your eyes haunt me always?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>she whispered, wringing her hands so hard that the diamond
cut into her flesh.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny could scarcely be called a religious person, but
every night of her life since she could remember, except
her bridal night, she had said the Lord’s Prayer, either
with Annie, or Katy, or Paul, and now from force of habit
she knelt by her berth, which reminded her of a cupboard
shelf, and began the familiar words. Her voice was choked
with sobs, and when she reached “Forgive us our trespasses,”
she said instead, “Forgive what I have done, and
take Jack’s eyes away, or I shall die.” Once in her berth,
which was as comfortable as a berth on a ship can ever be,
Jack’s eyes ceased to haunt her, and she might have fallen
asleep if she had not heard her husband’s step near the door.
“I can’t speak to him to-night,” she thought, with a shiver,
and closing her eyes she feigned sleep so successfully that
when, as he called her name and she did not answer, he
cautiously parted the curtains and looked at her, he believed
her asleep, she lay so still, with her hands folded across
her breast. Jack would have kissed her at the risk of waking
her. The Colonel only thought how fair she was and
that her beauty was his own, as he dropped the curtain and
went to his couch under the window, where he was soon
sleeping as soundly as if outside the wind was not rising
until it blew a gale, while the steamer rolled and pitched in
a manner well calculated to terrify one not accustomed to
the sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>For awhile Fanny listened to the roar outside and to
the noise overhead as the sailors hurried to and fro. At
last when she could bear it no longer, she called to her
husband, “George, George, I am so frightened. Are
we in danger? Do ships ever tip over?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tip over! No. There is no danger. It is only a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>little spurt of wind. It will soon pass. Go to sleep,
child,” the Colonel answered drowsily, and his sonorous
breathing soon idled the room again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny could not sleep, and as the wind increased and
the ship rolled more and more she decided that if she must
drown it should be with her clothing on. She got out of
her berth and steadying herself by it reached up for her
dress which she had hung upon a hook and which was
swinging out in straight lines, with everything else which
could swing. Heretofore she had only been afraid. Now,
however, she was suddenly conscious of a new sensation
so overmastering that she crept back into her berth, wondering
if she were dying, as the cold, clammy feeling crept
from her toes up to the roots of her hair, which seemed
in her nervous imagination to stand on end. As yet there
was no other feeling in her stomach than one of faintness
and chill,—but when she raised her head the nausea was
so severe that the Colonel was roused from his sleep and
came at once to her aid.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Am I dying?” she asked, and he answered with a
laugh, “Dying! No. It’s only seasickness. You will
soon be over it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>All night the retching and nausea continued, and when
the grey dawn came struggling through the porthole
Fanny was as limp and white and still as if she were dead.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Colonel had called the doctor and stewardess
when his remedies failed, and they had removed her from
the berth to the couch under the window where she
would have more air and light. And there she lay,
motionless, for if she stirred so much as a finger or
turned her head the terrible paroxysm seized and shook
her until there was scarcely strength in her to move. It
was the worst case he had ever seen, the doctor said, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>the day wore on and she did not improve. He had
said this a good many times when he knew his patients
wished to be exceptions, but he meant it now, and became
greatly interested in the young bride, who puzzled
him somewhat. As the seasickness decreased it was succeeded
by a severe pain in the head, with a burning fever,
so that at times she was delirious, and said things the Colonel
would have given much if she had left unsaid. Jack
troubled her, or rather his eyes, which were always looking
at her. Many eyes he must have had, as they were
everywhere, and especially upon the wedding ring and
the solitaire. Here they blinded her if her hand lay outside
the sheet. If she covered it up, she saw them
still;—not as distinctly, but saw them looking at her,
sometimes mockingly, but oftener reproachfully and full
of pain.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jack, Jack, go away!” she would say imploringly,
and once, when the Colonel was standing by her, she
slipped the rings from her finger and handing them to him
said, “His eyes are on them all the time. Take them
away, and perhaps I shan’t see them so often.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Colonel took the rings and put them in his vest
pocket, with a feeling that he was beginning to reap in
some small measure what he had sown. It did not take
long for his friends to know about the mysterious Jack
whose eyes haunted his wife, and one lady, bolder and
more curious than the others, asked him, “Who is
Jack? Her brother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is not her brother,” was the curt reply, and the
gleam in the Colonel’s eyes warned the lady not to pursue
the subject.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Curse him!” the Colonel said to himself, as he went up
on deck and in the face of a fierce north-easter walked back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>and forth for half an hour or more, his hands in his pockets
and his head bent down as if to break the force of the
wind which beat so furiously upon him, but which he
didn’t feel at all.</p>

<p class='c014'>A hurricane would scarcely have moved him, so bitter
were his thoughts and so deeply wounded his pride. He
knew the ways of a ship and how the passengers, shut up
within themselves, hailed anything like gossip and made
the most of it, and he knew they were discussing his affairs
and building up theories with regard to the Jack whose
eyes sat on his wife’s pillow,—on the door,—on the window,—and
lastly on her wedding ring, which she had discarded.
A few had been in to see her and what they had
not heard the stewardess had told, and every possible conclusion
was drawn with regard to the matter. All this he
guessed as he walked the deck cursing his rival, who, far
away, was seeing Fanny’s face just as she saw his, for this
was on Tuesday night, when Jack was at his worst.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Curse him, and her, too, for loving a poor country
fellow like that in preference to <em>me</em>,” the Colonel said, and
the emphasis on the <em>me</em> told how infinitely superior he
though himself to Jack Fullerton and people like him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Accustomed all his life to deference and preference on
account of his wealth and family and distinguished appearance,
he could not understand how a man like Jack should
be preferred to himself. In love in its purest, truest sense
he did not believe. It was a vealy sensation at its best,
fit only for the very young. Mature people knew better
than to indulge in it. The happiest marriages were marriages
of convenience or advancement, where for value
received an equivalent was paid and the bargain a fair one.</p>

<p class='c014'>That he had not married before was his own fault.
There was scarcely a young woman of his acquaintance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>either in Washington or New York, who would not have
thought twice before refusing Col. Errington, and he knew
it. Had it not been for his sister’s presence in his household
he might perhaps have married earlier, but aside from
their little disagreements she had made him so comfortable
that he had never seriously considered matrimony
until little Fanny Hathern stood up so fearlessly and
scorned him to his face with all his troops behind him.
He had never forgotten her, and had always cherished a
vague belief that she would some day be his wife. When
at last he made up his mind in earnest, he resolved that
nothing should stand in his way. He never asked himself
if he loved her. She would make a fine centre for his
surroundings. She was bright and spirited and beautiful
and he wanted her, and had won her against the odds of
another suitor to whom she was pledged, and her wedding
day only a month in the distance. For Jack and what he
might feel he did not care at all. He was a man and
would get over it, and possibly marry the other twin,—the
little brown-eyed woman whom he scarcely remembered,
except that she was small and quiet and gentle and far
better suited to Jack than Fanny with her piquancy and
dash. It had been a fair bargain, he thought; money and
position <em>versus</em> youth and beauty. He meant to fulfill his
part and give her everything his wife ought to have.
Why shouldn’t she fulfill her part, too, and be satisfied?
Why should she hanker so after that fellow, calling his
name as he heard her call it on the deck,—talking of him
continually in her delirium,—seeing his eyes everywhere
until he himself began to have a creepy feeling and see
them, too. He had been as near loving her as he could
love any one when she kissed him in their stateroom and
called him George, and that increased his anger. Jealousy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>and mortified pride were torturing him about equally
as he strode on in the face of the wind, which increased
more and more, until a sudden lurch of the ship sent him
into the midst of a pile of chairs and brought his walk to
a close.</p>

<p class='c014'>With what sounded like an oath he struggled to his feet
and descended to the saloon, where a number of his friends
were sitting, mostly ladies, and all discussing the mysterious
Jack. He did not hear a word they said, but he knew
at a glance the purport of their conversation, and a hot,
angry flash showed on his face for a moment. Then, on
the instant, he became his olden self,—the easy, courteous
gentleman,—and when his wife’s illness was alluded to, he
spoke of her with great concern and apparent affection.</p>

<p class='c014'>The world should never know by any act of his of the
rage in his heart when he thought of Jack. Outwardly he
would be the most devoted of husbands, paying Fanny
every possible attention. Alone with her, when the world
could not take note;—— Well, he hadn’t made up his mind
what he would do if this nonsense continued. The past
could not be helped, and she was not responsible for the
secret she had betrayed to so many, but in the future it
must be different.</p>

<p class='c014'>When at last he went to his stateroom he found her lying
much as she did that first night when she feigned sleep
that he might not speak to her. She was not feigning
now. Her breath was regular and natural, and there was
a faint color in her cheeks which had grown thinner within
the last few days. Her hands were folded on her breast
as they had been that first night and he noticed more than
he had ever done before how white and small they were,
and noted, too, with a pang, the absence of the wedding
ring still reposing in his vest pocket. When would she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>wear it again? Would she ask for it, or would he have to
offer it to her?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never! I’ll be —— first,” he said aloud, with so much
vehemence that Fanny stirred in her sleep,—moved her
head a little, and with a smile said, “What did you say,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am not Jack. I’m your husband,” he answered
savagely, and in a moment Fanny’s eyes opened and
looked at him questioningly. Then she said, “Oh,
George, is it you? I dreamed I was at home and somebody
was swearing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know you were dreaming of home,” he replied,
which made Fanny’s eyes open wider and shine with a
kind of reddish light, as they often did when she was surprised
and perplexed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Was he angry, and why? and had she talked in her sleep?
She didn’t know, and she continued to look at him so
appealingly, that he felt his wrath giving way and a sensation
of something like pity taking its place.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are better,” he said, and sitting down beside her
told her whatever he thought would interest her and that
they were not very far from Queenstown. “I shall cable
from there to my sister, who, I suppose, is at The Elms,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What day is it?” Fanny asked, and he replied, “Sunday.
We ought to be at Queenstown this afternoon, but
the rough weather has kept us back. We shall see Ireland
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sunday;—yes;” Fanny said, remembering that everything
was known in Lovering by this time, and wondering
how Jack took it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The seasickness and fever were gone. She was only
weak from their effects, but quite herself mentally. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>knew that she had dreamed of home and Jack, and wondered
if she had talked of him, but dared not ask. Lifting
up her hand to push her hair from her forehead she
noticed the absence of her rings, and looking at the Colonel
with a smile she extended the ringless hand to him
and asked, “Where are they? I seem to remember something
about their worrying me. Did I take them off?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes; you said there were eyes in them looking at you
all the time. They are here. Do you want them again?”
he replied, and held them up before her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, yes,” she said. “Of course I want them. How
it would look for me to be passing as your wife with no
wedding ring; put it on, please.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It does not take much to soothe a man if he cares at
all for a woman, and in a way the Colonel did care for
Fanny very much, and the touch of her hand on his and
the light which shone in her beautiful eyes fired the flame
again, and he held her hand for a moment before he put
the rings in their place; then, stooping over her, he kissed
her on her forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next day they reached Queenstown and a cablegram
that they were safe was sent to The Elms. Once he
thought to stop at Queenstown and make the remainder of
the journey overland; but Fanny was very comfortable
now; the sea was comparatively calm and they kept on to
Liverpool, which they reached the eleventh day out from
New York. He would like to have gone directly to London,
but Fanny was too utterly exhausted to allow of it.
She was almost as helpless as a little child, and a porter
carried her in his arms to the carriage in which she was
driven to the North Western Hotel. Here two or three
days were spent until her strength came back and she
could walk across the room without a feeling that the floor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>was rising up to meet her. It was Saturday before she
was quite equal to the journey. Then, securing a first
class compartment all to himself, the Colonel started on
the second stage of his rather stormy honeymoon.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.</span><br> <span class='c013'>ON THE ROAD TO LONDON.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>He was very attentive to Fanny during the rapid journey
from Liverpool to London. Fearful lest she should
take cold, as the day was raw and misty, he wrapped her
fur-lined cloak around her,—made her put her feet upon
the hot water jugs,—gave her the whole of one side of the
compartment, himself taking the other, although he detested
riding backwards. Removing the arms of the seats
on her side he arranged the rugs and pillows so she could
lie down when she was tired. Then, seating himself in his
corner opposite, he unfolded his newspaper, pretending to
read although he really was for the most of the time furtively
watching his wife and wondering of what she was
thinking, and if all the luxury and comfort with which he
tried to surround her were as nothing when compared to
the lover she had given up for him. When they entered
the carriage she had sunk down wearily into the softly
cushioned seat,—had thanked him with a bright smile for
his care, and then looked out upon the people hurrying up
and down the platform in quest of places, and wondering a
little who would come in with them and why they didn’t
come. Once the anxious face of a young English girl
looked in at the window and in a relieved voice called out,
“Here mam-ma; here are plenty of seats.” But the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>door did not yield to her touch. It was locked and the
Colonel’s quiet “Engaged for an invalid,” sent her on
down the long line of carriages destined for the St. Pancras
Station in London. The English girl was followed
by a tall, strikingly handsome woman of twenty-eight or
thirty, wrapped in rich furs, and accompanied by a little
withered old man, who was talking French and gesticulating
wildly with both hands. As the lady was the taller of
the two, it was she who glanced in at the window, with the
question “<i><span lang="fr">Ya t’il des places ici,—oui, oui</span></i>,” and she pulled
at the handle of the door. “<i><span lang="fr">Mon Dieu</span></i>,” was her next
exclamation, but whether elicited by the unyielding door
and the Colonel’s “Engaged, madame,” or Fanny’s face,
on which her great black eyes rested for a moment as if
fascinated, was uncertain.</p>

<p class='c014'>She moved on and the little old man waddled after
her, while Fanny put her head from the window to
look again at the woman whose face had struck
her as one she had seen before.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was not possible, though, as she had never known a
real French woman, such as this unquestionably was.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why is the door fastened, keeping everybody out?”
she asked, and the Colonel replied, “I don’t care to travel
with Tom, Dick and Harry. I have engaged the whole
compartment.”</p>

<p class='c014'>That one could do this was new to Fanny, and she sank
back into her seat with a feeling of dismay at the prospect
of being shut up alone with her husband for three or four
hours. She was beginning to be a little afraid of him.
Not for anything he had done, but for something in the
tone of his voice and the expression of his eyes, which
seemed to be looking at her constantly until they made her
almost as nervous as Jack’s had done when she was ill.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>When the train left the station and the Colonel resumed his
paper she felt relieved, and began to look with curiosity
and interest upon the lanes and hedges and gardens and
houses they were passing so rapidly, and which, under the
wintry sky, had none of the freshness and greenness she
had associated with England. Gradually she became conscious
that, instead of reading, her husband was watching
her over the top of his paper, with something hard and
cruel in his eyes which she could not understand. She knew
nothing of what she had said in her delirium, or how bare
she had laid her love and longing for Jack, and did not
dream of the fierce jealousy and hatred of his rival filling
her husband’s mind and making him see <em>Jack</em> written all
over her face just as she had seen his eyes everywhere when
the fever was upon her. At last, tired of the dreary landscape,
and more tired of the scrutiny she could not fathom,
she lay down among the cushions and rugs and fell into a
dreamless sleep from which she did not fully rouse until
they were entering the suburbs of London. Once, when
they were stopping at a large town she was conscious that
her husband said “Engaged” to some one, and of hearing
the hum of disappointed voices outside. Again, she
knew that a rug was thrown over her, and a window shade
adjusted so as to shield her from any cold air which might
find its way to her. He was certainly kind and she felt
grateful for it, and when at last she was fully awake and
sitting up, she gave him a smile so bright and beaming
that he felt his pulse quicken, and the blue demons which
had taken possession of him were less blue and tantalizing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have had a splendid sleep. Where are we now?”
she said, pushing the curtain away from the window which
was covered with dirty splashes of rain.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>“In London,” he replied, and Fanny became alert and
interested in a moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>To see London had been the dream of her life and one
she had never expected to be realized. Now, she was
here, and the outlook was dreary enough, with the yellow
fog hanging low over the city,—the gas jets dimly shining
through it,—the pools of water in the streets,—and the
dirty streams mixed with coal dust and cinders falling
from the roofs of the houses. All her old homesickness
came back, and she felt utterly desolate and as if she
wanted to be near someone. Taking her seat by her husband
and leaning her head on his shoulder she said, “Oh,
George, this is dreadful. London is ten times worse than
New York ever thought of being.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is a deuced nasty day, but it will not always be
foggy,” he replied, as he busied himself with getting his
bags and bundles together.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, it will not always be foggy, nor shall I always feel
as I do now,” Fanny thought, and the natural hopefulness
of her nature began to assert itself.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was quite cheerful by the time the train ran into
the St. Pancras Station and began to unload its passengers.</p>

<p class='c014'>As she alighted from the carriage she ran against and
nearly knocked down the little Frenchman, who was evidently
trying to soothe and quiet his wife, if she were
his wife. Her back was towards Fanny, who saw only
the outline of her figure, and the coils of yellow hair
under her hat. She was talking loudly and evidently
greatly enraged, but as she spoke in French Fanny could
not understand her. There was no more doubt that she
was a virago than there was that the little man was the
most patient and henpecked husband in the world. In
response to Fanny’s, “I beg your pardon, sir,” as she ran
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>against him, he took off his hat and said in broken English,
“I you ask pardon, too, mademoiselle, to be so in your
way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then turning towards the lady, “Madame quite—<em>fache</em>;
madame, you see,—<i><span lang="fr">voiture</span></i>, so full <i><span lang="fr">des Americaines, et des
enfants</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At the sound of his voice, madame turned and Fanny
met again the great black, flashing eyes, with dark rings
under them and a dusky look generally, such as brush and
pencil and belladonna give to eyes where art has been at
work. They were, however, quickly withdrawn, as if the
lady were ashamed that she had been heard, and while
Fanny, puzzled again, was trying to think if she could ever
have seen those eyes before, she hurried away with the
little man following her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Were they quarreling?” Fanny asked, and the Colonel,
who understood French perfectly, replied, “I think
she was angry because the compartment she was in was full
of children and Americans, whom she evidently does not
like.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh,” Fanny said, “you ought to have let her in with
us. She interests me somehow, and the old gentleman is
lovely. I reckon it is good pious work to live with
Madame. I think he crossed himself once when she was
blowing him. See, there they are now,” and she pointed
to the couple entering a hansom at no great distance from
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>The lady was giving directions to the driver, who bowed
assent, closed the little trap door and drove away. Calling
another hansom the Colonel bade the man take them
to Morley’s Hotel. It is a long way from St. Pancras to
Morley’s, and before the hotel was reached all the street
lamps were lighted, looking like so many tapers in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>thick fog which had settled everywhere and was almost
as penetrating as rain. Damp to her skin, tired and cold
and homesick, Fanny was driven along the gloomy streets,
which seemed interminable.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We shall soon be there now,” the Colonel said, as he
saw how she drooped, and felt her leaning against him.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few moments later they turned into Trafalgar Square
and she heard the splash of the fountains and saw dimly
the outlines of the huge lions guarding the place.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here we are,” the Colonel said, as they drew up before
the hotel, from the windows of which cheerful lights
were gleaming, while two or three lackeys in uniform came
hurrying out to meet them.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.—Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>AT MORLEY’S.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>The Colonel had telegraphed for a suite of rooms on the
second floor looking out upon the Square, and he found
them ready for him. A cheerful fire in the salon, another
in the bedroom, with every candle lighted in the chandelier
and in the candelabra upon the mantle. Divesting
herself quickly of her wet wrappings Fanny took an easy
chair before the fire, towards which she held her cold
hands, while she said, “This is delightful; the rooms are
lovely, and I am so glad to be here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a time she was glad. Jack and the old life had
nothing to offer like this luxurious apartment, with the
warmth and the light, and a little later on the waiter asking
when Madame would have dinner served.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now,—at once,” the Colonel answered for her, saying,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>when the man had gone, “We dine in here. I have
no fancy for <i><span lang="fr">table d’hôtes</span></i> with all the canaille and
bourgeois round me. One can’t be too careful in Europe
as to his acquaintances.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny, who was very social in her nature and liked to
see people, preferred, as a rule, to mingle with them, but
to-night she was so tired that she was glad to dine by themselves,
and she felt a thrill of satisfaction that she was
able to do so without counting the cost. Once, when
quite a young girl, she had gone to the Spotswood in Richmond,
with her father, who was not feeling well and to
whom she had suggested that he have his dinner in his
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, daughter; there would be an extra charge and I
cannot afford it,” he had said.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was very poor then;—she was rich now, and need
not mind expense. It was a good thing to be rich, and
she felt glad and content as she nestled down in the easy
chair and felt its soft folds about her and the glow of the
fire on her face and watched the two waiters laying the
table for dinner, with cut glass and silver and the finest of
linen, and a vase of flowers in the centre.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If father were only here to share it with me,” she
thought, recalling the many straits to which poverty had
reduced them. “If he could share it with me,—or Annie,—or
Katy,—or—Jack!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The last name sent her blood rushing so hotly through her
veins that she moved away from the fire as if it scorched
her. She did not mean to be disloyal to her husband,
and it did not occur to her that she was as she began to
wonder how she should feel if it were Jack whom she
heard stepping around so briskly in the dressing-room,
making himself ready for dinner. She could see just how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>he would look lounging easily up to her with a smile on
his face and in his laughing eyes which had never rested
upon her except with love and tenderness. It was not
Jack, but a tall, stern, dignified man, who emerged from
the dressing-room just as the soup was put upon the table,
and led her to her seat. The dinner was excellent and
well served, and Fanny, who was hungry for the first time
since her marriage, enjoyed it with a keen relish of a
healthy appetite. She was young and hopeful and elastic in
her temperament, and as her spirits rose she laughed and
joked until her face, which had lost something of its freshness
during her illness, grew bright and sparkling, and
her husband thought with pride how beautiful she was
and almost forgave her for the <em>eyes</em> which had troubled
her so on shipboard. They had gone through all the
courses and the black coffee had been brought in. This
the Colonel took by the fire, while Fanny still sat at the
table sipping hers and occasionally tasting a Hamburg
grape. The waiter had just gone out when there was a
knock at the door and a servant entered bringing a cablegram
upon a silver salver. It came several days ago, he
said, and the clerk at the office had forgotten to give it
to the gentleman when he registered.</p>

<p class='c014'>Naturally the Colonel put out his hand to take it when
the waiter said quietly, “If you please, it is for the lady.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“For me!” Fanny exclaimed in surprise. “Who can
have telegraphed to me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Taking the message in her hand she read the address
aloud:—“Mrs. Geo. W. Errington, Morley’s Hotel, London,
Eng.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was the first time she had seen her new name in
writing, and it gave her a peculiar sensation as she
studied it for a moment.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“It’s a cablegram from home and may have bad news.
Open it,” the Colonel said, and instantly Fanny’s fingers
were tearing at the envelope and she was reading the message:
“The Elms, Thanksgiving morning. To Mrs.
G. W. Errington. Mr. Fullerton is here and very ill with
brain fever. Recovery doubtful. C. Errington.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment everything in the room swam before
Fanny’s eyes, but she neither spoke nor stirred until the
Colonel, alarmed at the whiteness of her face, came to her
side and asked “What is it?” She gave him the cablegram
which he read aloud and then said, “That’s bad.
A fever is likely to go hard with a man of Mr. Fullerton’s
temperament.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The next moment he repented his words, calling himself
a brute, partly for his thoughtlessness and more for
the vindictive feeling which had prompted it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Jack! I have killed you,” Fanny cried, stretching
out her hands, and then lying back in her chair in a
dead faint, the first she had ever had in her life.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was one thing to give Jack up voluntarily, and know
that somewhere in the world he was still alive, remembering
and loving her, as she believed he would, and another
thing to think of him as dead,—gone out of her life forever,—murdered
by her. That was the way she put it,
and murderess was the word in her mind when she cried
out, “Oh, Jack, I have killed you.” She had no doubt
as to the cause of his illness. He had received her letter,
enclosed in Annie’s, and been stricken down at once in
the old home where he had expected to make her his wife
and where both Miss Errington and Katy were now.
When Thanksgiving came on the <em>Celtic</em> she was too ill to
know or care what day it was, and she had not thought of
it since. But she remembered now all the bright anticipations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>of that day of which both Annie and Jack had
written to her,—the dinner they were to have and for
which Phyllis was making so great preparations, and after
dinner the walk or drive to “Our house on The Plateau.”
This last was the burden of Jack’s letter to her, and now
she was another man’s wife, and Jack was dying, or dead.
All her work, and she was as surely a murderess as if with
her hand she had killed him. It takes some time to tell
all this, but it scarcely took Fanny a second to think it,
so rapid were her thoughts and conclusions before she
became unconscious. The Colonel had seen death in
many phases on the battlefield, but no face had ever
affected him like this, which was so still and white with a
grieved expression around the mouth pitiful to see. He
was glad he was alone with her, and when he heard the
servant coming to clear the table he called to him to wait
until he got Madame to her room, as she was ill. Taking
her in his arms he carried her to their sleeping-room,
loosened her dress, laid her upon the bed, and then applied
every restorative which came to his mind, water, cologne,
camphor, bay rum and ammonia, with no effect whatever
for a time, and he began to wonder if it were possible for
her to die upon his hands. At last, however, after what
seemed to him an interminable length of time, she recovered
and asked in some surprise what had happened,
and why her hair and dress were so wet and why she was
on the bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You had a cablegram and fainted,” the Colonel explained,
and then it came to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I know,” she said, with a sob. “Jack is dead,
and I killed him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Humbug!” the Colonel answered, sternly. “He is
not dead. If he were my sister would have cabled again.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>This message was sent several days ago. Brain fever
runs its course quickly. He is better by this time. Don’t
make another scene. Restrain yourself. I am not fond
of high tragedy, especially when the hero is another man.
I have had enough of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny had never heard him speak like this, and her
heart stood still a moment and her breath came in short
gasps, as she watched him putting the bottles of camphor
and cologne and bay rum in their places and saw how pale
he was and how his hands trembled. Something like pity
for him was in her heart, but a stronger feeling overmastered
it. She must know if Jack were living.</p>

<p class='c014'>“George,” she said, her voice compelling him to go to
her against his will. “George,” she continued, looking
up at him with eyes which held his, much as he wished to
withdraw them, “I am sorry for it all, but I must know
if Jack is alive, and you must cable to your sister to-night,
if possible,—to-morrow, sure.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mentally the Colonel swore he wouldn’t, but Fanny’s
face conquered, and the message “How is Jack?” which
his sister received was sent by him with Fanny’s name
appended. The next two days were not very merry ones
to either the Colonel or Fanny. <em>She</em> sat silent and shivered
by the fire, counting the hours as they went by, and
every time there was a knock at the door starting up in
hopes that the word which meant life or death had come.
<em>He</em> spent many hours in the smoking and reading room
trying to divert his mind from what weighed upon him
almost as heavily as it did upon Fanny. Again, he took
long walks through the damp and fog, cursing his folly in
marrying a girl who loved another as he now knew Fanny
loved Jack, and trying to arrange his future. She was his
wife. Nothing could undo that, and he did not know that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>he wanted it undone. He could still be very proud of
her, if she would behave herself and not go pining and
puling after another man, and this she should do. He
was resolved upon that. Whether Jack lived or died she
was to seem to forget him and be loyal to himself outwardly,
whatever she might feel. She had married him for
money. She should have it in full measure, and return to
him an equivalent in obedience to his will. No one had
ever thwarted that with impunity, and his wife should
not be the first to do it. It seemed to him he had walked
over nearly half of London when he came to this conclusion
and began to feel that he was tired. Hailing a hansom
he was driven to the hotel where he found his sister’s
second cablegram, which he took at once to his wife. She
was sitting just as he had left her hours before, wrapped
in a shawl before the fire, with a hopeless look upon her
face, which made him angry, and also sorry for her as he
handed her the envelope and watched her as she tore it
open and read, “He is better.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He had never dreamed that a face could change as hers
did in an instant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“George, George,” she exclaimed. “He is better; he
will live; and I am not a murderess. I am so glad; so
glad.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was not chilly now. The shawl was thrown aside,
and it was her own suggestion that they should dine below
with the other guests rather than in their private salon as
they had done heretofore.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now that I do not feel the mark of Cain on my forehead
I want to see people. I have been mewed up here
long enough,” she said; and the Colonel assented, although
in his present state of mind he cared little where
he took his dinner.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>He asked for a table apart by himself and to it he
conducted his wife, whose grace and beauty could not fail
to attract attention, and who talked with him as airily as if
there were no sore spot in her heart which would never
quite cease to throb with a dull pain when memory’s fingers
touched it. At some little distance from them, at a
table by themselves, sat the Frenchman and his wife, the
little man bowing and throwing out his hand very politely
to Fanny, while saying something to the lady whose back
was to them, and who never moved from her rather stiff
position. She was elaborately and elegantly attired, evidently
for the opera. Her dress, V-shaped before and
behind, showed a part of her white, plump neck, on which
a few short golden curls were falling from the coil arranged
above them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look, George; there’s the little old man and his wife;
I wonder who they are,” Fanny said, and the Colonel replied,
“They are registered ‘Monsieur and Madame
Felix, Paris.’ The clerk says they come here often and
that he is very rich. I imagine she is a terror, as I overheard
her giving him Hail Columbia for something. I
couldn’t tell what, but fancied it was about <em>you</em>, and that
he either wanted her to call at our door and inquire, or
send you some flowers. He remembered seeing you at
the station and had taken the great liberty, he called it,
to ask for you, and seemed concerned when I told him
that you were not well and were keeping your room. She
affects a great deal of hauteur and reserve, but is a magnificent
looking woman,—very Frenchy, with her dark
eyes and yellow hair. I thought at first it might be a wig,
but it isn’t; it is all her own, growing on her head. I had
a glimpse of her in the hall one day, hurrying to her
room, in a crimson silk dressing-gown, with all that hair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>hanging down her back below her waist. She knew I saw
her and actually smiled upon me, showing a set of very
white, even teeth and a pair of brilliant eyes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Cold and passionless as the Colonel seemed he never
saw a beautiful woman that he did not at once take in
every point of her beauty from her head to her feet, and
as the French lady, who had excited Fanny’s curiosity,
was beautiful, or certainly very attractive, he waxed so
eloquent over her that some women might have been jealous.
But Fanny scarcely heard him. She was thinking
of the cablegram which had relieved her anxiety for Jack,
and of the long letter she meant to write to Annie that
night. The Colonel was going to the opera and had asked
her to accompany him, but she did not feel quite strong
enough. So he left her alone and she began her letter,
telling of her fearful seasickness and homesickness, and
her remorse and pain when she received the news that Jack
was dangerously ill; struck down, she was sure, by her
act.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If he had died I should never have known another
moment’s peace of mind, for I should have known I was
the cause of his death,” she wrote. “But, thank God
he is better, and there has been a little song of joy in my
heart ever since I heard it. The world could never be the
same to me with Jack gone from it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As she began to feel tired she did not finish the letter,
but left it open on the writing desk, intending to finish it
in the morning. She did not hear her husband when he
came in, nor knew that her letter had caught his eye at
once, with Jack’s name occurring so often on the page open
in view that he had stopped and unconsciously at first
read a few lines. Ordinarily he would have held another’s
letter sacred, but now with his anger and jealousy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>aroused he took up this and read it with wrath and disgust.
The next morning when Fanny awoke she found her husband
up and dressed and standing by the bedside looking
at her. Opening her eyes drowsily, and smiling up at him,
she said, “Have I overslept? What time is it, please?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He did not answer her, but instead held up her letter
which he had read again with more bitterness than on the
previous night.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fanny,” he began, and his voice was full of concentrated
anger and determination, “this nonsense must be
stopped. I have had enough of it. You are my wife. I
cannot control your thoughts, but I can your actions, and
I will not have you writing home such sentimental trash
as this about seasickness and homesickness, as if you were
the most wretched woman in the world. If you were so
fond of Jack, why under Heavens did you take <em>me</em>,—and
having taken me why do you prove faithless to your marriage
vows by clinging so to <em>him</em>. This letter will <em>not</em> go
for my sister or your adorable Jack to exult over, saying
we are both reaping our just deserts.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He tore the letter in shreds, which he threw into the
fire. For a moment Fanny was speechless, then all her
spirit and temper rose and her eyes were like two volcanoes,
emitting spits of flame, as she said, “Do you call
yourself a gentleman, and is it usual for gentlemen to
read their wives’ letters as you have read mine?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The taunt stung him, but he would not apologize, although
he winced under the blaze of her eyes and the lash
of her tongue. For a moment he let her have her own
way and say what she chose; then buckled on his armor,
which she could no more resist than she could strike her
head against a wall hoping to move it. The fire in her
black eyes was more than matched by the steely hardness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>of his, as he met her impetuous reproaches with words
spoken very slowly and very low, but which left her vanquished
and him master of the field and of her. It was a terrible
battle, southern fire against northern coolness, and
the latter conquered. Henceforth Fanny would go when
he told her to go, come when he told her to come, do
what he bade her do.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But thank God I can <em>think</em> what I please and of whom
I please, and you cannot help yourself,” was her last defiant
fling, as she dressed herself hurriedly and sat down
to the breakfast which was served in their parlor and had
waited some time while the matrimonial difference was
settled.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hot as was Fanny’s temper there was nothing sullen or
vindictive in her nature, while the Colonel prided himself
upon never striking a superfluous blow after the nail was
driven in. If he was fierce in war he could be generous
in peace, and if the waiter who served them that morning
had been questioned upon the subject, he would have reported
them as examples of conjugal harmony and affection.
Madame, he might have said, was rather quiet,
with a bright red spot on either cheek, while <em>Milor</em> was
very attentive to her, urging her to eat, and planning
where he was to take her that day. First, shopping. He
had met several friends the night before, both English
and American, all of whom were coming to call. He had
an invitation to dinner the next day but one at the house
of an English lady, who had spent a part of a winter in
Washington and been entertained by him and his sister.
She had just heard he was in London and hoped he would
accept her invitation, if it were rather late to give it. He
also had tickets to hear Patti, and was to occupy a box
with Lady <em>Hyer</em>, an American, who had married an earl.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>This necessitated a suitable outfit, and all the morning
was spent at Marshall &#38; Snelgrove’s and Peter Robinson’s,
deep in the mysteries of silks and velvets and laces,
as shown and recommended by the saleswoman and pronounced
upon by the Colonel, who proved a connoisseur
in matters of dress, and without really seeming to do so
decided on every purchased article. Surrounded by so
much elegance and receiving so much attention and deference,
Fanny’s spirits rose. The scene of the morning,
though rankling a little, was partially forgotten in the
glamour of the dinner and evening dresses which were
finally decided upon and were very becoming to her. The
corsage of both was high, notwithstanding that the saleswoman
had pleaded for something different.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam’s neck was so white and smooth that it was
a pity to cover it even with lace,” she said, while Fanny’s
choice was the same as hers, but that did not matter.
The Colonel knew her neck was smooth and fair, but it
was for him only. No other man should look upon it, and
he vetoed the low necks, but yielded to the short sleeves,
which would only leave bare her arms, over which the saleswoman
went into ecstasies.</p>

<p class='c014'>All that evening and a part of the next day boxes of
dry goods of various kinds kept coming to the Colonel’s
apartments, which looked like some gay bazaar with Fanny
in the midst, excited and seemingly happy and oblivious
of all that had gone before, except occasionally when a
sigh, or a sudden pressure of her hand upon her heart told
that she remembered and was exercising her right to think
her own thoughts untrammeled by anyone. The Colonel
was very suave and gracious, enjoying her enthusiasm
and smiling upon her as upon a wayward but conquered
child. On the night of the dinner party, as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>stood before him, radiant and lovely, and asked what he
thought of her, he answered, “I think you will be the
most beautiful woman there, after I have made a few additions
to your toilet. Look here,” and pulling her down
beside him, he laid in her lap a pair of exquisite diamond
earrings, the stones large and white and clear, and showing
their value by their brilliancy and depth. He fastened
them in her ears himself, and then clasped around her
wrists a pair of superb bracelets, scarcely less expensive
than the diamonds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, George,” she said, as she stood up and saw in
the mirror the flash of the precious stones which enhanced
her beauty, “Oh, George, you are kind, and I thank you
so much, and I mean to be good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The last words were spoken with a half sob as she put
her arms around his neck. She didn’t kiss him. The
memory of the bitter words he had said to her was too
fresh in her mind for that. But she was grateful and
pleased, and as the Colonel had predicted, she was by far
the most beautiful woman in Mrs. Harcourt’s drawing
room and received the most attention. There was nothing
like <i><span lang="fr">gaucherie</span></i> in Fanny’s manner. She conformed
readily to the atmosphere around her, and the English,
usually so critical where Americans are concerned, forgot
to criticise and found her wholly charming and let her
know they did. Never in her life had she been so flattered
and admired, and never had she been more sparkling and
said brighter, wittier things in a ladylike way than now.
She had found her place in society at last; the one she
had dreamed of but never thought to attain, and for the
time she was happy, drinking the brimming cup, and the
past was blotted out. She had often said to herself, “It
is good to be rich and somebody,” and she said it now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>with great unction as the people crowded around her
and vied with each other in paying her homage. Among
them was Lady Hyer, who, proud of her countrywoman,
invited her with her husband to spend the Christmas holidays
at her house in Surrey, where she was to entertain a
large party.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I should like it so much, if my husband thinks
best,” Fanny said, her eyes dancing with delight as she
anticipated the pleasures of a visit in an English country
house where she knew she would be the queen.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yes, it was good to be rich and somebody, and as the
Colonel, although non-committal on the subject, seemed to
favor the plan, she felt sure that she should go, and began
to think of other dresses which would be necessary if a
week were spent at Grey Gables, Lady Hyer’s country
seat. She might perhaps have gone there if it had not
been for the undue attentions of Tom Hyer, Lord Hyer’s
younger brother, who made no attempt to conceal his admiration,
and who, when the gentlemen were left alone
with their cigars, urged the Colonel to accept his sister-in-law’s
invitation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’ll meet no end of swell people there and in
the neighborhood,” he said. “Cream of society, and
madame will be in the swim at once, don’t you know: The
Prince occasionally visits at some of the houses, and, by
Jove, I heard he was coming this winter. If so, Lou,
that’s Lady Hyer, will nab him if she can; and let him
once see madame, her success is sure, don’t you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I know,” the Colonel replied, bowing stiffly and
longing to thrash the cad who thought that the notice of
the Prince could add to his wife’s reputation.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the contrary it would detract from it, and he wanted
to tell him so. But the shallow young man would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>have understood him, if he had. He had finished his
cigar and joined the ladies, and when the Colonel returned
to the drawing room he found him seated by Fanny and
filling her ears with the gay times she would have at Grey
Gables, where he hoped to meet her again. But the festivities
of Grey Gables and its neighborhood, with the
Prince of Wales as a possible central figure, were not for
Fanny, and when she asked her husband why he declined
the invitation, he answered curtly, “Because I choose to
do so.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Two days after the dinner party Fanny wrote another
letter to her sister very different from the first. There
was no regret in it for what she had done,—no mention
of homesickness, or Jack; nothing, in short, that the most
jealous and exacting husband could not read. She offered
it to the Colonel when it was finished, but he declined,
saying in much the same tone a father might adopt towards
a child who had been punished for some misdemeanor,
“I think I can trust you now that you know
what my wishes are. I will direct it for you, if you like.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny handed him the envelope, and while he was addressing
it added the few words which embodied so much
love and longing for news from home and Jack and told
Miss Errington that the bending process had begun as she
had predicted it would begin. There were one or two more
dinners with lunches and calls and drives, and then the
Colonel began to talk of the continent and Paris. There
he intended finding a maid for Fanny and a valet for himself.
Both were necessary adjuncts and would add to his
importance, he thought. To Fanny the idea of a maid
was very pleasing, but she preferred one who spoke her
own language as well as French.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If I could only find Julina Smith, I should like it,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>she said, “and I think she would be glad to see me. I
suppose, though, she is married by this time, or is too fine
a person to be a maid. But she might know of some one
who would be trusty, which is a great thing to be considered.
Her aunt, whose name was Du Bois, kept a French
pension, and Julina lived with her. Perhaps Madame
Felix might know the place, as she lives in Paris. I wish
I dared ask her. I know she is here yet, but she avoids
me as if I were the plague.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For answer to this the Colonel laughed derisively at the
idea of consulting Madame Felix with regard to a <em>pension</em>.
There were ways of finding Du Bois and Julina, too, if
necessary, he said, without interviewing Madame, who
never heard of either. He, too, knew that she was still
in the hotel, although he seldom saw her. The little old
man was ill and she took her meals in her room with him.
Occasionally, however, the Colonel came upon her walking
up and down the hall as if for exercise. At such
times she always gave him a nod of recognition, with a
lighting up of her eyes which interested him more than
he cared to confess. She was very aristocratic in her feelings
and very exclusive he was sure, and this did not at
all detract from his desire to know her. Meeting her in
the hall the day after his conversation with Fanny he
lifted his hat a little more deferentially than usual, and
begging her pardon for the liberty, ventured to inquire for
her husband who he had heard was ill.</p>

<p class='c014'>Instantly Madame’s fine eyes became humid, and her
voice full of pathos, as she replied that Monsieur, although
better, was still too ill to continue their journey to Paris
where she so desired to be, or rather to Passy, where they
had a chateau full of servants waiting impatiently for
them.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>The Colonel was naturally very much concerned about
Monsieur and very sorry for Madame, who was most artistically
dressed and looked very handsome as she stood
in the shadow with her back to the light. The Colonel
knew that she was artificial and Frenchy through and
through, but she attracted him as she did every man, and
he went on to speak of the weather and Paris, where he
was soon going, and then he rather awkwardly dragged
in Julina Smith and the Du Bois Pension, which his wife
was anxious to find. It was hardly probable, but just
possible that Madame, who knew Paris so well, might
have heard of the Du Bois Pension and could direct him
to it. Not that he expected to stop there, or at any other
pension. He was going to the Grand, he hastened to
say, as even in the shadow he saw the light kindling in
Madame’s eyes and mistook its meaning. His wife was
very anxious to get on the track of Julina Smith, who had
once lived in her family, and might be of some service to
her in selecting a maid.</p>

<p class='c014'>For an instant Madame Felix was silent; then, with an
outward gesture of her hand, as if thrusting from her something
obnoxious, she said in a hard, sarcastic tone, “Monsieur
the Colonel does me great honor to enquire of me for
the Du Bois Pension and Julina Smith, but I know neither
one nor the other, I never kept an intelligence office.
Good morning, Monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With a haughty shrug of her shoulders she swept down
the hall, leaving the Colonel discomfitted and abashed, and
a good deal ashamed of himself. What should a superb
creature like Madame Felix know of Du Bois and Julina
Smith, and what a fool he had been to speak of them to
her and incur her contempt. He did not tell Fanny of
his adventure, which he knew was prompted not so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>by a desire to learn of Julina Smith’s whereabouts as to
talk with Madame, who had rebuffed him as he deserved.
The little old man, as Fanny always called Monsieur, must
have recovered strength rapidly, for the next morning,
when the Colonel went to the office he found him sitting
there wrapped in furs and shawls, waiting for the carriage
which was to take him to the Victoria Station. Putting
out his wrinkled, withered hand, he bade him good morning
cheerily. He was feeling better, he said, and as
Madame had suddenly taken it into her head to go home,
they were going, as far as Paris at least. He had an incurable
and painful disease, and should probably never see
England or Monsieur again, he said; but he spoke very
cheerfully, as if the next world would be quite as pleasant
as he had found this. Then he inquired for Fanny and
sent his best compliments to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She has a bonny face, which interests me,” he said.
“She has smiled pleasantly upon me. I like her. I thank
her. Tell her so. If I live, and you stay long in Paris,
come to the Hotel Felix in Passy. <i><span lang="fr">Au revoir</span></i>, Monsieur.
Here is Madame.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She came bustling in, muffled to her chin in her wraps
and followed by her maid and her husband’s valet, who
took possession of his master and almost carried him to
the carriage outside. Madame’s adieus were politely
made, but she did not second her husband’s invitation to
Passy, or inquire for Fanny. She had not forgiven him
for Du Bois and Julina Smith, but her hauteur relaxed a
little when he conducted her to the carriage and stood
with uncovered head as it drove away. Three days later
he followed in the same direction, and for a time fades
from our canvas and is lost sight of in the mazes of Continental
travel.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.—Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>CHANGES IN LOVERING.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Two years had passed since Annie sat with Jack in
“our room” at The Plateau and read the letter which
came so near wrecking his life, and now it was the day before
Thanksgiving and she was alone in the great silent
house. Katy, Paul and Jack were all gone, and only the
memory of what had been was left to keep her company.
It was nearly six months since Katy left for Europe with
Miss Errington, who had had the young girl with her much
of the time since Fanny’s marriage and had given her the
best musical instruction in Washington. Miss Errington,
who had no particular prejudice against the stage, and who
believed that a pure good woman could be as good and
pure there as elsewhere, had not at first discouraged Katy’s
leaning towards it. This was before she knew her well
and understood how simple-hearted and innocent and
trustful she was; believing everyone to be what he seemed,
and how she recoiled from every thing like deception or
sham or unpleasant familiarity. Such a girl was not fitted
for the stage, where she must at times come in contact
with much that would shock her refined and sensitive
nature. And when Miss Errington came to understand
this she changed her tactics and very quietly threw her
influence the other way. But the seed had been sown
and Katy never listened to a prima donna that she did
not feel a desire to stand in her place and see what she
could do towards moving the crowd as Nilsson and others
moved it. For the theatre and its plays she did not care.
The opera was her ambition, and she believed she could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>fill the largest house in the world and scarcely feel the
effort. Several times she had sung at receptions, and once
in public with other amateurs for some charitable object,
and as she heard the bursts of applause which greeted her,
and received the quantities of flowers thrown at her feet,
she thought, “If this is what it is to be a public singer it
must be delightful.” Then she remembered Carl’s words,
“I would rather see you dead than on the stage.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan had said the same, but her saying was not quite
like Carl’s. “And yet he is nothing to me that I should
care for his opinion,” she thought, knowing the while
that she did care, and that the most thunderous applause
that ever shook the Grand Opera House in Paris, or Berlin,
or Naples, would be nothing to her if Carl’s approval were
withheld. She had met him once or twice during her winter
in Washington, and his attentions had been so loverlike
that Miss Errington had said to her, “Carl Haverleigh
will propose to you if he has a chance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shall not give it to him; for if I did and accepted
him he would forget me in a month,” was Katy’s answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>She still remembered the rambles in the woods and the
talks beneath the pines in the hillside cemetery, at home,
when he had looked and acted love, if he had not spoken
it, and she remembered, too, his words to Annie, accidentally
overheard, “If any girl thinks my attentions to her
more than those of a friend it is because she does not
understand me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She did understand him, she thought, and as she
had treated him on Thanksgiving day at the Elms, when
he had proposed sending for the clergyman and having a
wedding after all, so she treated him now,—pleasantly,
familiarly, but never giving him an opportunity of being
alone with her. He came to New York to see her off, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>with Miss Errington and Norah, who accompanied them
as maid, she started for Europe. Owing to some misapprehension
with regard to the sailing of the steamer he
only reached it in time to see her for a few moments, and
that with a crowd of people surging around them. Just
at the last, when the command for “all ashore who are
going ashore” was given, he said, “I hear you are to
study music in Berlin, and with Marchesi in Paris. Is
that so?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Possibly,” she replied, and he continued: “Have
you still career on the brain?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Something in his tone irritated her, and she answered
promptly, “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then, good-bye,” he said, and taking her hand he
wrung it hard and left her.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were hundreds of people upon the wharf and hundreds
upon the ship as it moved away, but Carl saw only
one,—a tall, slender girl, in a sailor hat with a blue veil
twisted around it, who waved to him until the boat swung
out into the river and she was lost to view. Annie’s
good-bye had been said at home, where she was left alone
with Paul and Jack.</p>

<p class='c014'>Over the latter a change was gradually coming. It is
often the case that when God takes one blessing from us
he gives us another in its place, and this was verified with
Jack. He had lost Fanny, and the loss for a time crushed
him bodily and mentally, blotting all the sunshine of his
life and leaving him without hope or courage or faith in
anything. Then reaction came with renewed health and
vigor, and he woke to the fact that God was not the cruel
master he had thought him when his hour was at its worst.
There was still something left to live for. Old interests
began to come back—in the people around him and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>his business. The latter was prospering greatly. Stocks
in which he had invested were rising in value. Lands
which he had thrown upon the market with little hope of
sale were in demand, as were also his services as agent for
a large commercial house which paid him double the salary
he had before received. This necessarily took him a
great deal from Lovering, which he still called his home,
although he had rooms in Richmond and St. Louis, where
a part of his time was spent. The house on The Plateau
remained unsold and closed,—not for lack of purchasers,
as several offers had been made him for it, but he declined
them all. “Some time, perhaps, I shall sell it, but not
now. I am not ready to part with it yet,” he would say,
and clung to it with a persistency which surprised his
friends, and none more so than Annie. To her it seemed
like a tomb, with its barred doors and closed shutters
and air of loneliness around it. She still kept the keys,
and every week or two went up and opened it to let in the
air and see that all was safe. Everything was there as
it had been two years ago, except the piano, which Miss
Errington had insisted upon having returned. The chair
in which Fanny was to sit and watch for Jack stood in the
bay window with the table and the work-box upon it.
The medallion, so like Fanny as a child, still smiled on
Annie whenever she entered the room. Every time Jack
came to town, whether for a longer or shorter stay, he
went to The Plateau, sometimes staying hours and sometimes
only minutes, as the fancy took him. What he
thought or felt as he sat or walked through the rooms,
where so many hopes had been born and died, no one ever
knew, for he gave no sign except that his face, when he
left the place, was sad, as our faces are when we come
from the graves of our dead. But this was wearing away.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>His step was growing more elastic, his voice more cheery,
and his whole manner more like himself. “He is getting
over it,” people said, and were glad and rejoiced with him
in his recovered spirits and increasing prosperity. His
home proper in Lovering was now at the hotel, where his
room was fitted up with some of his mother’s furniture, but
he spent most of his time at The Elms with Annie. He did
not call her Annie-mother now, or often call her anything,
or talk as much to her as he used to do. And she was
content to sit with him in silence, satisfied to have him
with her and glad that he was in a more healthful state of
mind. Fanny’s name was never mentioned by him, or to
him by any one, and, for all he knew, she might have been
dead and buried.</p>

<p class='c014'>The last Annie heard from her she was in Paris with her
husband, who was suffering from rheumatism and malaria,
contracted either in Rome or on the Riviera, and which
was so severe as to confine him to his room and chair.
In her last letter, written in October, Fanny had said,
“We are coming home as soon as George can make up
his mind to bear the journey from Paris to Havre.” After
this Annie knew nothing more of her except the little she
heard from Paul, who had been in Paris with Carl three
months or more. The physician in Richmond, to whom
he had been taken by Annie, had made light of his lameness,
saying it would wear off in time. But it did not
wear off, and after Katy’s departure it increased so rapidly
that Annie felt constrained to write the truth to Carl
and ask what she was to do. As if anxious to make amends
for any former neglect or forgetfulness, Carl had written
very often to Paul since his last visit to The Elms, and had
sent him many packages, containing sometimes money,
sometimes books and toys, or whatever else he thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>would please him. And now, on the receipt of Annie’s
letter, he came at once full of concern, which deepened
when he saw the child’s worn face and the slight limp he
could not conceal. There was a rapid journey to Philadelphia,
another to New York, and a third to Boston, with
consultations in each city with the best surgeons and with
the same verdict,—hip disease in its incipient stage. Each
one consulted was sure he could effect a cure, and each
also admitted that probably better medical aid could be
had in Paris than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then to Paris we will go,” Carl said to Annie on his
return to The Elms; “and you will go with us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Annie shook her head. She had a mortal terror of
the sea which she could not overcome. To save Paul’s
life she would cross it, but hardly otherwise. Fanny was
in Paris; Katy was somewhere in Europe with Miss Errington
and Norah, and would undoubtedly go to Paris if
necessary. “With Fanny and Katy both there you will
not need me, and somebody must stay and keep the home
fire burning for the rest to come back to when they are
tired of wandering,” she said, conscious as she said it of
another reason of which she could not speak.</p>

<p class='c014'>Aside from her dread of the long journey and her terror
of the sea was a growing feeling that she could not leave
Jack. No word of love for her had ever passed his lips,
but something told her that over the grave in his heart
new hopes were springing, the tendrils of which were
reaching towards herself. When he last started on his
journey west, which was to last for a longer time than
usual, he had thrown his arm across her shoulders as he
stood talking to her in the hall before bidding her good-bye.
Looking up in his face she had seen something in
it she never saw before and which made her drop her eyes
and hang her head.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>“God bless you, Annie,” he said, putting his hand under
her chin and turning her face up to his again, “God
bless you for all you were to me in the dark days which
are brightening now so fast that I see the past only through
a mist, and that is rapidly lifting. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He stooped and kissed her on her forehead and was
gone, but his kiss still burned where he had imprinted it,
and she saw the look in his eyes and heard his voice speaking
to her as he had never spoken before. So when Carl
came and asked her to go to Europe, she shrank from it
with a feeling that she could not.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know I am selfish,” she said, “and it breaks my
heart to have Paul go without me, but indeed I cannot
go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After this Carl did not urge her, but began to look
around for some reliable man with whom he could trust
Paul at all times and in all places. This point Paul settled
himself. At the time when Sam Slayton had been
caring for Jack at The Elms a great friendship had sprung
up between the little boy and the man, and this had increased
as time wore on. Almost every day found Paul at
the corner grocery, where he sometimes waited upon customers,
but oftener sat upon the counter talking to Sam,
who said of him to his friends that he was “the cutest little
cuss he ever saw;” while Paul in turn worshiped him as
the best man in the world, excepting Carl and Jack.
When Miranda came, as she did in due time, the intimacy
was not interrupted, but rather increased; for in her loneliness
and longing for the five brothers she had left in Vermont,
Miranda took at once to the little boy, whose prattle
amused her so much. For a year the visits to Miranda
continued, and then one morning there were streamers of
crape on the doors of the house and grocery, and Miranda
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>and her own little boy were coffined and ready for the
journey back to her grave among her native hills. This
happened while Paul was in New York with Carl, and on
his return he found his friend alone, and crying like a child
as he talked of his dead wife and baby.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m broken all to smash,” he said, “and have got to
go away from here, where every pound of sugar and every
quart of vinegar reminds me of Miranda and the little
shaver I was goin’ to call for you, if Miss Annie was
willin’.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This made Paul feel at once related to the baby which
had looked only a few minutes upon the world before it
died, and altogether akin to the bereaved man whose
rough hand he held between his small white ones, patting
and rubbing it in token of sympathy. When told that
Paul was going to Europe Sam began to cry again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish to lan’ I could go, too, and look after you and
the Square,” he said. “I’d be as faithful as a dog, an’
I can’t stay here with these things hauntin’ me and
makin’ me think of her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As a result of this, Sam Slayton was hired by Carl to go
with him to Europe and care for Paul.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not a high-toned valet,” Carl said to Annie; “but I
like the fellow, and can trust him, and he has promised to
be a little more choice in his language, and the slang
phrases which Paul is apt to adopt.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Sam rented his corner grocery, bought a new suit of
clothes, went to the hills of Vermont and said good-bye to
Miranda; and then he joined Carl and Paul in New York,
and with them sailed away to Europe, shocking Carl sometimes
with his broad Yankee dialect, but proving the most
faithful and loyal servant a man ever had, and, when it
was necessary, the most efficient of nurses.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>With Paul gone and Jack still away, Annie was very
lonely. Carl had, in a delicate way, made everything as
easy for her as possible, depositing to her account what
seemed to her a large sum in a Richmond bank where she
kept her small funds. He had also insisted that a young
girl should be hired, and as Phyllis approved the plan, a
bright mulatto named Rachel was installed in the house
as maid, though really she waited upon Phyllis more
than upon Annie. But she was young and full of life, and
sang as she worked, and often brought Annie bits of gossip
from the outside world, which kept her from stagnating.
Paul’s letters were a great comfort to her. He had early
learned to write a childish irregular hand, and every week
there came a letter from him, sometimes longer, sometimes
shorter, but very dear to the Annie-mother, who
he wished could be with him and see all he was seeing.
He was under treatment, with the prospect that he would
be cured in a little while, and this was comforting. He
was at the Grand Hotel in Paris, where they talked the
queerest talk he ever heard. Even the children spoke
French, and he was going to learn it, too,—and Sam, at
whom everybody looked so funny, especially the English,
who sometimes laughed at him. But Sam didn’t care a
<em>su-mar-kee</em> for one of them, and Paul didn’t care a <em>su-mar-kee</em>
either. Sam was just as nice as he could be, and had
learned every ’bus line in Paris, and knew that <em>couplet</em> did
not mean a place, as he had first thought it did, trying in
vain to go there, and hunting all over the map of the city
to find it. He hadn’t seen Katy, and didn’t know when
he should. She had been to the <em>North Pole</em> to see the sun
rise,—then to Stockholm and Russia, and was now in
Berlin and was going to Egypt in the winter. <em>Fan-er-nan</em>
was in Switzerland, but was coming to Paris by and by.
All this was in his first letter.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Later on he wrote: “They’ve put me in a plaster jacket
and it hurts me some; but I try not to cry, and Sam
takes me in a chair along the boulevards and down to the
Palais Royal, and everywhere, and yells like a panther at
the cabmen when he wants to cross the street and they are
aiming at us. ‘Git back, you scallywags, don’t you see
the little boy is lame?’ he says, and they <em>git</em> every time.
You ought to hear him try to talk French. He can say
‘<em>Ong-tray</em>’ and <em>Com-bee-ang</em>, and <em>Petty garsong</em>,’ and some
more words, and screams when he talks to the people, and
they scream at him. I am learning French and teaching
English to a nice lady, and this is how it happened. I was
sitting in my chair in the court with Sam and my French
primer, when there came up to me a very handsome lady
with great black eyes and yellow hair and rosy cheeks,
which Sam said were painted, but I don’t believe it. She
put her hand on my head and said something I couldn’t
understand. I knew it was French and answered, ‘<em>I nee
parl paw French</em>’—I had learned so much from my primer—and
was very proud when the lady laughed and said, ‘<em>Tray
be-ang</em>;’ she meant very good, or very well. Then she
tried Sam, but he shook his head and said, ‘<em>Nix cum arouse</em>,’
at which she stared awfully. She staid until Carl came
up. He didn’t know her and she didn’t know him, but
she bowed and he bowed, and they talked some, and Carl
made her understand what ailed me. She looked real
sorry, and put her hand on my head again and kissed me
and went away. I saw her at dinner, where she sat near
us, dressed oh! so beautiful, and everybody looked at her,
and she didn’t care.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Carl said she was Madame Felix, and the little fussy-looking
old gentleman with her was her husband, and was
ill; that’s why he looked so yellow and shut his lips so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>hard as if he didn’t feel well. I like him, and so does
Sam. He came to me after dinner and talked English
very bad, but I understood him. Madame <em>Julee</em> he calls
her, wants me to teach her English words and she will
teach me French. Carl is willing, and every morning now
she comes to me and tells me French and I tell her English,
which she pronounces sometimes real good, as if she
knew it before,—then awfully, and I laugh, and she laughs,
and Carl laughs. He is always with us, learning French
with me and teaching her English, too. Sam sits and
listens and catches on, he says. I’ve thought sometimes
Carl wanted him to go away, but he won’t. He don’t
like Madame. He says she makes eyes at Carl, and once,
when he saw her talking and laughing with him, he said,
‘What tarnal fools.’ I told Carl, and he was mad.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sam is going to learn French as fast as he can so as
to know what Carl and Madame Julee say to each other,
but I am not to tell. I said I wouldn’t, though I don’t
see why Carl shouldn’t know that Sam can understand.
Do you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>In Paul’s last letter he wrote: “The little old man,
Monsieur Felix, has gone to his chateau in Passy. Madame
asked Carl and me to go, too, and we wanted to, but
Sam looked like a thunder cloud, and had some high words
with Carl, and said how was I to be treated in Passy. So
we didn’t go, nor Madame either. The little man told
her to stay if she wanted to, and she staid. She told Carl
it was so lonesome in Passy,—<em>treest</em>, I think she said, and
the housekeeper and servants would take good care of
Monsieur, and she could not bear to be shut up in a sick-room with camphire and odor-cologne and nerves; it
made her head ache. And Carl said he didn’t much blame
her and should miss her awful. I am getting to understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>pretty well and faster than Sam, and made this out,
but didn’t tell him, he hates Madame so.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My plaster jacket hurts me sometimes and I cry, but
Sam is so good, and says if I bear it like a man I will one
day be tall and straight like Carl. He is splendid, and I’d
bear anything to be like him. We get on beautiful in
French, and Madame beautiful in English. Queer, how
well she pronounces at times. I told her so, and she said
I was not to tell Carl, because he’d think if she pronounced
well once she might always, and she is pretty bad when he
is with us. Two secrets I have now,—her’s and Sam’s,—and
they make my head ache. Madame has taken me to
drive two or three times, and once she had a box at the
Opera and took Carl and me. Oh, it was beautiful,—the
house and everything, except the ballet. I didn’t like
that,—the girls’ dresses were so short and thin, and they
whirled so fast and threw their feet so high that I didn’t
dare look at them much till I heard everybody cheer,
Carl and Madame with the rest. Carl looked at them
through an opera glass, although he was pretty near the
stage. I had heard Fan-er-nan say something about Katy
going on the stage, and I whispered to Carl, “Would Katy
do like that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘God forbid!’ he said, and turned white, and I said
I’d get right down on the floor and hide if she did.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madame laughed,—seems as if she understands all I
say. She was splendid that night,—nothing on her neck
but diamonds, which glittered so in the light. Ever so
many glasses were aimed at her, and she liked it. After
the opera we went for supper to <em>Bean-yon’s</em>, an awful dear
place. But Carl didn’t mind. He ordered everything
Madame wanted and a bottle of wine. But he didn’t
drink. He’d promised his sisters not to, he said. Madame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>shrugged her shoulders and drank to the health of his sisters.
I was so tired I fell asleep in my chair, and when
they tried to wake me up they couldn’t. So they sent
for Sam, who carried me home in his arms. It isn’t far
from <em>Bean-yon’s</em> to the hotel. I slept late next morning,
and when I woke Sam was cross as a bear,—not to me,
but at Carl, who had gone to Passy with Madame to call
on Monsieur. Sam slatted things round and said he wished
to Cain that Katy or Fan-er-nan would come and stop
it. I asked him ‘Stop what?’ and he said, ‘Stop your
asking questions.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sam is funny. Carl has come back and Madame
hasn’t. I guess the little old man is pretty sick. I miss
Madame and so does Carl, but Fan-er-Nan will be here
soon.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In his next letter Paul wrote: “Fan-er-Nan is here,
and such a great lady. Not like Madame,—stiller, prouder,
whiter,—I can’t tell you what. ‘Big swell, but cold as
a snowball. I knew it would be so,’ Sam said; but she
isn’t cold to me. She took me in her arms and hugged
and kissed me and sobbed like, but didn’t shed any
tears. I told her not to feel so bad,—my back was
getting well. She hugged me harder, and said, ‘There
are worse things than backs.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“What did she mean? Sam heard her, and after she
went out he said, ‘The cuss!’</p>

<p class='c014'>“He didn’t mean Fan-er-Nan, for I asked him; and he
didn’t mean Madame, for she isn’t here. She was away.
I tried my hand at a letter, half French, half English, and
told her to hurry up and see Fan-er-Nan, and she wrote to
Carl she couldn’t come, Monsieur was so ill. Fan-er-Nan
has a maid and talks French as well as Madame, but she
is so——I don’t know what,—like something bottled up.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Sam says she dresses lovely,—not like Madame exactly,
plainer, but in a way you know is first class.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have seen the Colonel, and oh my, I don’t wonder
Fan-er-Nan seems so still. Why, he’s <em>old</em>, and his foot is
all swelled up, and lies out on a cushion, and he has a
crutch, and scowls when he talks. He was nice to me, but
I didn’t stay long and was glad to get out of the room.
They are going home before long. I suppose I shall want
to go with them. But I must get straight first, and I like
Paris and Carl, he is so kind to me, and when I tell him
I am a bother, he says, ‘Oh, Paul, you don’t know all
you are to me, you and Sam both.’ He calls me his good
angel, and Sam his watch-dog. Queer, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Paul’s letters troubled Annie. Who was this French
woman, and why was Carl so interested in her? At last
she decided to ask him about her. She was owing him a
letter and would write that night, she thought, as she sat
waiting for her supper to be served. Since she had been
alone she had abandoned the massive mahogany table
which Mrs. Hathern had brought from Boston, and taken
her meals upon the little round table which had been her
mother’s. This now stood by her near the fire, for the
day had been cold, and as it drew to a close the wind began
to rise, making it colder still. Dark clouds were scudding
across the sky, and as the sun went down the rain
began to fall, reminding Annie of that day two years ago
when she had brought Jack from The Plateau more dead
than alive, and Fanny had been on the sea. Where was
Jack now, and where was Fanny? and would she come to
Lovering after her return? Paul had said she was coming
home soon. Perhaps she was there now and had not written.</p>

<p class='c014'>The train which used to pass through Lovering at four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>o’clock now came at quarter past five, and Annie heard
the whistle and wondered if there would be a letter for
her. She would send Rachel after supper to inquire, she
thought, just as a rapid step came on to the piazza and
some one entered the side hall. The dining-room door
was thrown open, and starting to her feet Annie stood face
to face with Fanny.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX.—Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>FANNY.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>She had been driven from the station to the head of the
avenue where she alighted, telling the driver she would
walk to the house. Seeing no light except the one in the
dining-room she had entered that way, and in a moment
had Annie in her arms crying like a child for joy. Fanny
didn’t cry. It was a long time since any tears had come
to soften the hardness of her eyes. But there was a
choking in her throat as she felt Annie’s arms around
her neck and took in all the old familiar objects,—the carpet
she remembered so well,—the clock on the mantel,—the
wood fire on the hearth,—the tall andirons,—the fender,—the
round table with the simple meal upon it,—and
Annie herself, grown younger instead of older, and so
plump and round and fair that people called her handsome,
with her sweet face, her soft brown eyes and hair
and the bright color on her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, Annie,” Fan said at last, turning her round so
that the fire-light fell fully upon her. “How lovely you
are, and how young. I might almost pass for your mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>I am so old and have lived so many years since I saw
you. I believe that we are both twenty-eight, and that is
not so very ancient, but I feel a hundred.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was taking off her hat and sealskin sack and gloves,
and stood at last revealed to Annie an elegant woman in
every respect, with fashion and style and travel and wealth
written all over her from the way she spoke and wore her
hair to the tip of her French boot which she held up to the
fire. Paul had said of her that she was still and white.
She was more than that, and seemed to Annie for a time
like a marble statue, talking and moving by machinery,
with no will of her own. But she began at last to thaw,
shaken into something like the Fan of old by Phyllis, who,
hearing she was there, came rushing in and taking her in
her arms nearly squeezed the life out of her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Honey, honey,” she said, while the tears ran down
her cheeks, “I thanks my Heavenly Father dat dese ole
eyes has lived to see de comin’ of de glory of de Lord.
Dat’s de song we sing in meetin’, and you’s de glory,
shoo’, so gran’ and fine. Oh, glory, glory, glory, hallelujah,
hallelujah, Amen!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Fan’s old laugh rang through the room, as she
said, “Don’t have the power, Phyllis, for pity’s sake. It
will take more than Annie and me to drag you out. Better
bring me some hot coffee and a plate, so I can have
my supper with Annie.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This brought Phyllis from the skies down to the commonplace,
and lamenting that she hadn’t known her
chile was comin’ so as to have had something fit for her,
she bustled in and out, bringing everything eatable there
was in the house, and then waiting upon the young ladies.
Rachel, she said, was well ’nuff for common, but she
reckoned nobody was gwine to wait on Miss Errin’ton
but herself.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>At the mention of that name Fanny shivered and put
down the cup of coffee she was drinking.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Call me Miss Fanny while I am here as you used to
do,” she said, and laying her head back in her chair she
closed her eyes, while there passed before her in rapid review
all that had happened since she was Miss Fanny and
sat with Annie as she was sitting now with Phyllis attending
her.</p>

<p class='c014'>She had neither been beaten nor sworn at, nor had
things thrown at her, as she knew some wives had; the
Colonel was too much of a gentleman to do that, but she
had been moulded and disciplined and thwarted until it
seemed to her she had but little will power left. Just
how her husband had subjugated her so completely she
could not tell, but subjugated she was, doing as a rule
only what he bade her do, and going only where he bade
her go. For a time after leaving Paris he had been very
proud to see her admired and sought after and had taken
her everywhere. Thoughts of Jack ceased to trouble him.
He supposed Fanny still thought of him, but she was
perfectly exemplary as his wife, and seemed to care
little for the attention she received, and he was
quite content. Then, for no fault of hers, he suddenly
conceived a most violent jealousy of every man who
looked at her, or rather at whom she looked, and began
to curtail her liberty, telling her where she could go
and where she couldn’t. At Monte Carlo, where they
spent several weeks, he took her with him once into the
roulette rooms, which interested her greatly. She had
no thought of playing, but she liked to watch the others.
As there were some friends with her she did not always
keep by her husband, but went from room to room, animated
and excited and wholly oblivious to the many who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>looked admiringly after her, commenting on her beauty
and graceful carriage and wondering who she was. But
the Colonel saw it all, and for a short time enjoyed it.
Then, as he mixed with the crowd, he overheard some
one say, “Is it possible that stern, oldish-looking man,
with the bald head and scowl between his eyes, is that
lovely girl’s husband? I pity her, and him too. She’s a
high-stepper.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s so,” was the reply of a second man, who
seemed loaded with information. “They say she had
another lover whom she jilted for money and who died.
Quite a little romance, which will undoubtedly end in
another. Those eyes of hers don’t look at a fellow for
nothing. They actually talk. See, they are resting pityingly
on that poor devil who is losing his money so fast,
and now they are laughing up into the face of that Russian
who has spoken to her. Her old cove of a husband
needs to watch her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Colonel heard no more. He was boiling with rage,
and would have liked to knock down the man who called
his wife a high-stepper, and the other one who called him
an old cove and predicted a second romance. Evidently
he had allowed his high-stepper too much latitude when
men commented on her like this, but he’d stop it now.
Ten minutes later Fanny was told it was time to leave.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh please, George, not yet,” she said. “I like it
here so much, and it is not late.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For answer he drew her arm in his and walked away,
telling her it was no place for her, with her propensity to
attract attention. She was too gushing, he said,—too
demonstrative, pitying one man and smiling on another
and getting herself talked about. Thereafter he wished
her to be more quiet and reserved and keep her gush and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>smiles for him. She did not know what he meant or to
what he referred, but she grew quiet and reserved and
cold, and people called her proud and haughty, not knowing
that her heart was dead within her, and that every
natural emotion was kept down, with every semblance of
affection for or interest in anything. But if her fetters
were strong they were golden. She had all the money
she wanted until it palled upon her, and sometimes when
driving in her luxurious carriage she envied the peasant
woman whom she saw in the street, knowing that she
could do as she liked, with no one to question her. After
the Colonel’s lameness came on it was better. She had
more liberty, because she took it, and went where she
pleased. She never tried to deceive him, but told him
where she had been, what she had done, and whom she
had seen. He knew he could trust her and always believed
her. Once she told him of a young Englishman
who had only seen him in his chair with her walking beside
him, and who asked her when she met him again how
her father was. With a savage imprecation against the
young man, whom he called a fool, the Colonel cursed the
fate which deprived him of the use of his feet and was fast
changing his once erect and military figure into that of a
bent old man. He would go back to America and hide
himself in his own house, he said, and Fanny did not object.
Two years of travel and seeing the world had satisfied
her, and she was glad when the day of sailing came,
although she dreaded the voyage. Fortunately, she was
not sick, but the Colonel was and kept his berth most of
the time.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since his marriage nothing had been said of the cottage
at Newport, or of Palmetto Villa in Florida, and the grand
house which had been planned before they went abroad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>still remained on paper only. With his jealousy and morbid
state of mind the Colonel’s enthusiasm had cooled.
It was better to have his Washington house built when he
could see to it, he said, and Fanny acquiesced, as she did
in everything. So they went back to the old house on
Lafayette Square, and as the Colonel took possession again
of his rooms, with every comfort and convenience at his
command, he seemed happier than he had been since he
left them two years before. Fanny was very kind to him,
and had been so ever since his first attack of rheumatism
which disabled him from walking, and here, in Washington,
she was especially attentive, for her heart was expanding
with joy as she thought how near she was to the dear
old home which she meant to visit, whether he were willing
or not.</p>

<p class='c014'>Much of all this she told to Annie when, after the table
was cleared and the lamp put upon it, she sat on a stool
with her head lying in her sister’s lap like a tired child
which has come to its mother to rest. And Annie listened
with the tears sometimes running down her cheeks
as she caressed the beautiful head and smoothed the glossy
coils of hair, her heart aching as she detected in them
more than one thread of silver which was there before its
time.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe I told you in my letter that if I were unhappy
no one should ever know it,” Fanny said, in conclusion,
“but here, alone with you, it came out before I
thought. Don’t suppose, though, it has been all bad, for
it has not. I have enjoyed the foreign travel, of course,
and I have been nice to George and he has been nice to
me a good deal of the time. We have had our spats as, I
dare say, all married people do. I have always felt like a
slave, though, with an exacting master over me, and only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>liberty to think what I pleased. He couldn’t help that,
and I told him so in the hottest battle we ever had. My
thoughts are my own, and that is about all of myself I can
call mine. The rest of me belongs to him. When I remember
how high-tempered and self-willed I used to be,
I can’t see how he has done it. But he has. I am like
a spirited horse broken to the harness, stopping when its
driver says ‘whoa,’ and starting when he says ‘get up.’
It is better now,—a good deal better,—and if I could forget
I should really be quite contented. But oh, the forgetting!
I didn’t ask him if I could come. I told him I
was coming to spend Thanksgiving with you, and when
he said ‘Going to see your old lover, Jack, I suppose,’ I
answered, ‘I do not know that he is there. If he is, I
shall see him; yes.’ Then I came, but can only stay over
to-morrow. I must go back next day. I promised I
would.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In all she had told of her married life she had not
spoken of Jack until now, and at the mention of his name
Annie felt the blood rushing through her veins, and her
hands pressed very heavily upon Fanny’s head which
moved a little as for an easier position, so that a part of the
white face was visible in the fire-light playing over it.
For a while there was perfect silence in the room, and then
Fanny asked very low, “Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie told her where he was and how long he had been
gone, and that she expected him now at any time, as he
had written that he might spend Thanksgiving with her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That would be jolly,” Fanny said, sitting up a moment
with her hands clasped around her knees and her
eyes looking steadily into the fire. “Annie,” she said at
last, putting her head again in Annie’s lap, “you never
told me <em>how</em> he took it, or what he said. I only know he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>was very ill, and suppose I made him so. Tell me all
about it,—where he heard it, and when, and how he looked.
I want to know everything.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Fan,—no, no!” Annie replied. “You couldn’t
bear it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes I can. I have borne worse things than that. Tell
me everything. Maybe it will make me cry. I haven’t
cried in more than a year; not since I was ill in Naples
and dreamed I was a child again, and Jack came and put
his cool hand on my hot forehead and said ‘Poor little
Fan, does it hurt very bad?’ just as he did twenty years
ago when I fell from the swing in the barn and raised a
great lump on my head. I was so glad to see him, and
when I woke and found <em>he</em> wasn’t there,—that it was
George sitting by the window, and old Marcella trying to
coax into a blaze a smoky fire, I cried under the bedclothes
till the tear cistern ran dry. There has been nothing in
it since, and my eyes feel so hot at times that I’d like a
real thunder-storm. Tell me what he said and did.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie told her everything, sparing no detail and dwelling
at length upon Jack’s happiness in showing her all he
had done for his promised bride and his eager anticipations
of the morrow when he expected her. Then she
told of the letter,—its effect upon herself and its worse
effect on him,—of his anguish as he read it,—his despairing
cry which rang through the room in which so many
hopes had been centered,—his distraught manner as they
drove home through the rain,—his illness,—his loss of
faith in God, and his gradual recovery. Fanny’s face
was hidden and Annie could not tell whether she cried or
not. She only knew that she never stirred, but lay like
one asleep or dead, until she repeated Jack’s words which
had burned themselves into her memory.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>“Say it again, Annie. I didn’t hear you right. There’s
a roaring in my ears. Fanny—isn’t—married;—my
Fanny,—who was to have this room,—and watch for me.
No-o, Annie. No-o.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Fanny shook like a leaf, and one hand slid down
at her side into the light in which the costly jewels,—diamonds
and rubies and emeralds,—shone like eyes of
fire. Then she was still again,—so still that after the
story was ended Annie began to wonder at her silence and
tried to lift up the face in her lap. It was ghastly white,
and the long heavy lashes which lay upon it brought out
more clearly the dark circles under the eyes. Fanny had
fainted for the second time in her life. It did not take
long to restore her to consciousness. With the first dash
of water in her face she opened her eyes and gasped;
then, realizing what had happened, she shook the drops
from her hair and forehead and said with a laugh, “You
needn’t drown me. I was a great deal worse than this at
the hotel when I thought Jack was going to die.” Then
her eyes grew so large and black that Annie looked at her
in wonder. “It was terrible,” she said, “and I am not
worth all that pain. I could faint, but I can’t cry; I wish
I could. Poor Jack. You say he is over it now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think so,” Annie answered, with a thought of the
kiss he had left on her forehead at parting.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Does he seem as he used to?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very much.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Does he go to church?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He didn’t for awhile; he does now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What does he say of me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, never.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>“Do you mean he never speaks my name?” and there
were red spots in Fanny’s eyes and redder ones on her
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, he never speaks your name,” was Annie’s reply;
and Fanny continued, “And the house on The Plateau,—built
for me. What has he done with that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Kept it,” Annie replied, while the red spots left
Fanny’s eyes and cheeks and there was an exultant ring
in her voice as she said, “Then he has not forgotten me.
Oh, Annie, it has always been a comfort to believe that,
bad as I am, Jack still loved me. It has kept me from
many things I might have done. Col. Errington does not
know how much of my loyalty to him he owes to my faith
in Jack. But for that I might have defied him and been
the veriest flirt in Europe. There were chances enough.
I had only to look at a man to bring him to me. But I
seldom looked,—partly to keep at peace with my husband,
but more for Jack. Do you think he will come to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie hardly thought he would, or she should have
heard from him to that effect.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I feel that he will,” Fanny said with conviction.
“I hope he will. To see him again,—to hear his voice,
and know he didn’t hate me would send me back a better
and happier woman to my cage, every bar of which is
golden, but they hurt me just the same when I beat my
wings against them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie did not reply. She couldn’t say that she hoped
Jack would come. She had hoped so when the day
loomed before her long and lonely, but now it was different,
and the sight of Fanny might bring back the olden
love and leave her stranded just as the goal she longed
for was within her grasp.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>It was late that night before the sisters went to their
rooms, and later still before Annie could sleep. Fanny
slept soundly,—“like a top,” she said next morning,
when she went down to the tempting breakfast Phyllis
had prepared.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You looks pearter and more like Miss Fanny,” the
old negress said, as she bustled around the table, while
Annie, too, noticed the change.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was color in Fanny’s cheeks and her eyes shone
like stars, as she went around the house, changing things
a little, and wherever she went leaving a more artistic finish
than she found. Annie questioned her with regard
to Paul and Carl, and then spoke of the French woman,
asking if Fanny saw her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I saw her in London two years ago,—not in Paris,”
Fanny said. “She was in Passy with her husband, but
I heard of her from Paul and Sam. By the way, Carl
never did a better thing than when he took that Yankee
with him. He’s a curiosity to the foreigners, but faithful
as the sun. He doesn’t like Madame Felix. He says she’s
a sham and neglects her husband shamefully,—that the
old man is dying, and that if he does she’ll ‘set her cap for
Carl.’ That was the way he put it. But she’ll not succeed.
She is not a lady, and though Carl may like to
talk with her, as he does with every handsome woman,
he’ll never go further than that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is she so very pretty?” Annie asked, and Fanny replied,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pretty is not the term to apply to her, any more than
<i><span lang="fr">petite</span></i>. She is stout,—weighing at least a hundred and
seventy; but her figure and dress are so perfect that you
forget her size. She has large black eyes and yellowish
hair,—a peculiar combination, but Frenchy,—fine teeth,
high color, which she owes as much to powder and paint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>as to nature, but it’s well put on, and deceives the men.
There is something about her which attracts them, too.
She even won upon George,—or tried to. Me she ignored
and avoided. She reminded me of somebody, I could
not tell whom, and Sam said the same. He will keep
watch of her, and Katy will be in the field by and by.
From her pure lovely face Carl could never look the second
time at Madame.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then they talked of Katy and Miss Errington, neither
of whom Fanny saw in Europe,—and of the people in
Lovering,—and the morning passed and the two o’clock
dinner was served, and Jack did not come, and Fanny’s
spirits began to fall a little. When dinner was over she
said to Annie, “You told me you had the key to the
house. Give it to me, please. I am going there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie gave it to her and she was soon on her way to
The Plateau, taking a circuitous path through the woods
so as to avoid the villagers. It was dark when she came
back, and the lamp was lighted in the dining-room, where
Annie was sitting with the tea-table beside her. Fanny’s
eyes were very red as she knelt before the fire and held
her cold hands to the blaze.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have cried at last,” she said, with quivering lips
and choking voice, and that was all the reference she
made then to that visit to the house where God alone
saw the anguish of her soul as she went through the silent
rooms, with a feeling that it was her own grave over which
she was walking.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was in the upper room she lingered longest,—“Our
Room;”—Annie’s description had been concise and she
knew the chair where Jack had sat when he read her letter,
and she saw him there in fancy and heard his pitiful cry,
“Fanny isn’t married;—my Fanny! No-o, Annie, no-o.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>She went to the bay window and sat down by the table
where she was to have waited and watched for Jack as he
came up the hill, while from every part of the room came
the wailing cry, “No-o, Annie, no-o.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The windows,—the doors,—the ceiling,—the walls,—all;
caught it up and sent it back to her, until it seemed as if
her brain were on fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must cry or die,” she said, stretching out her hands
and fanning herself with them for more air.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then rising up she threw herself upon what was to have
been her bridal bed and lay there a crushed, remorseful
woman, hiding her face among the pillows whose softness
had a kind of healing in their touch, bringing tears at
last,—blessed tears,—which fell like rivers and cooled her
burning fever. She had wanted a thunder-storm, and she
had it. The tear cistern, empty so long, was filled and
refilled as often as it overflowed. The dainty pillow-shams
with her initial upon them were crumpled and soiled and
lay at last in a heap under her head, while the little girl in
the medallion looked smilingly down upon her, mocking
her misery. When her tears were spent and the choking
in her throat was gone she rose up, and laying her hands
caressingly upon every article in the room, as if in farewell,
went down stairs and out into the darkness, locking the
door behind her and saying as she did so, “Good-bye,
home which was to have been mine. I was not worthy of
you. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she went swiftly through the woods, reaching
home just as Annie was beginning to feel anxious about
her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have been through purgatory and feel all scorched
and blackened with its flames, but purified and better
somehow,” she said, as she rose from her kneeling posture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>before the fire and, taking her seat by the tea-table, she
began to talk and laugh as merrily as if she had really
been through purgatory and was entering Paradise.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some comment which she made about the knife she held
reminded Annie of the wedding present Carl had sent to
her two years before. She had written Fanny about it,
asking if she should send it to Washington, and Fanny had
replied, “Keep it until I come home.” Bidding Phyllis
bring the boxes Annie opened them, disclosing the contents
to her sister, whose surprise and delight were unbounded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are exquisite,” she said, “but our house in
Washington is full of silver and china. These were meant
for Fanny Fullerton, not for Fanny Errington. The silver
is marked “H.” Keep them for yourself when you
marry, if you ever do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The spot upon her forehead which Jack had kissed
burned so at the mention of her marrying that Annie felt as
if her sister must see it, and she put up her hand to cover
the place. All day she had half expected Jack and hoped
he would come. Better that he should see Fanny and
know that he is cured before he commits himself again,
she thought, as she watched her sister with a feeling that
if she had lost some of her girlish beauty and vivacity, she
had gained in grace and an indescribable something which
would distinguish her from hundreds of women.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Jack did not come, and Fanny left the next morning
without seeing him. Annie urged her to stay longer, but
she replied, “I promised and must keep my word like
that old chap Romulus, or Remus or Regulus, which was
it, who went back to Carthage and was rolled in a barrel
full of spikes. I shan’t be rolled in a barrel. On the
contrary, George will be glad to see me. I’m nice to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>most of the time. He says I bandage his foot better than
Clary,—that’s his man,—and I read to him by the hour,
and brush his hair, and am really quite a pattern wife.
When I can’t stand it any longer and he swears awfully,—not
at me,—he never does that,—but at Clary and his
foot, I go off by myself and say some big words and make
faces and look at my diamonds and read some slips cut
from papers about the beautiful and accomplished Mrs.
Errington, and feel better.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She talked as if she were wholly heartless, but Annie
knew her gayety was feigned and pitied her intensely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When George is better I mean to have you come to
Washington and see how grand I am,” Fanny said, when
dressing for her journey. “I knew a good many people
there as Miss Hathern, and as Mrs. Errington I shall know
more, and can introduce you to the best society. So
when I send for you, come.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was very bright and cheerful at breakfast, which was
eaten by lamplight, for in order to connect with the Washington
train she must leave Lovering at an early hour and
then wait in Richmond until nine o’clock or later.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t mind it at all,” she said, when Annie expressed
her regret at the delay, and as she tied on her bonnet
she began to hum a strain of an opera, keeping time to it
with her head.</p>

<p class='c014'>Was she then so glad to go back, Annie wondered.
The truth came out at last.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have a presentiment that I shall see Jack in Richmond
while I am waiting. I am almost sure of it. Oh,
Annie, you don’t know what it will be to me just to hear
his voice once more,” she said, and then with a good-bye
kiss she was gone and Annie was alone again.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter X.—Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>JACK AND ANNIE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Jack had hoped to spend Thanksgiving with Annie, but
had been detained a day longer than he anticipated, and
did not reach Richmond until Thanksgiving night. He
had come from the west and stopped in Washington the
very day that Fanny left for Lovering. He did not know
that she had returned from Europe until he overheard two
men in the office of the hotel speaking of the Colonel,
who, they said, was in a very critical condition, as there
was danger at any moment that his rheumatism might
attack his heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He will leave a handsome young widow behind him,”
one said, while the other nodded and replied, “She’ll
console herself readily enough with the lover she jilted.
You knew about that, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The man questioned didn’t know, and his friend began
at once to tell the story. But Jack didn’t wait to hear it,
and leaving the hotel he walked rapidly through street
after street, excited and angry that Fanny’s name should
be thus bandied about in public. His love for her was
gone, but he could not forget what she had been to him,
and it was dreadful to hear her spoken of in that way.
As he walked there came over him a desire to see where
she lived. It did not take long to find the place, and
standing on the opposite side of the street he looked curiously
at the great silent house, in which no light was shining
except in the hall and from the upper windows of a
corner room where the Colonel sat groaning with pain and
cursing himself for an idiot that he had let Fanny go even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>for a day. No one cared for him as she did, and he
missed her more than he had thought it possible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve been a brute a good many times, but I mean to
do better when she comes back. I don’t suppose, though;
I can ever make her love me. Confound that Fullerton;
I wonder where he is,” he was thinking, just as the electric
bell pealed through the house and kept on ringing, as
they sometimes do, until the housemaid, who hurried to
the door, stopped it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who the devil is that greenhorn ringing like that?”
the Colonel said, as every whiz of the bell rasped his
nerves afresh.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Jack. From seeing the house there had come to
him a desire to see Fanny.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing can better assure her that I am all over it
than calling upon her,” he thought, as he crossed the
street and touched the electric button.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Errington was not at home the maid said, and with
a half feeling of relief that she was not, Jack gave the
girl his card and left.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who was it?” the Colonel asked from the open door
of his room.</p>

<p class='c014'>The maid brought him the card.</p>

<p class='c014'>“John D. Fullerton, Lovering, Va.,” the Colonel read,
consigning Jack at once to the lower regions, together
with his aching foot which, at the sight of his rival’s name,
he had lifted high in the air, with the result of a sharper
twinge than any he had experienced. “What brought
him here, I wonder?” he thought, feeling glad that Fanny
was not at home and gladder still that she probably
would not see Jack at Lovering.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meanwhile Jack went to his hotel and the next day
parted for Richmond, reaching it too late for the train to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Lovering. Once he thought to telegraph Annie; then
decided to surprise her on Friday. It was necessary to
see his employers, whose office on the third floor commanded
a view in the distance of the plain across which,
about half-past nine on Friday morning, the Washington
train was speeding on its way with Fanny in it. While
waiting at the station she had looked into the gentlemen’s
room and walked through several streets, hoping that
chance might throw Jack in her way if he were in the
city, and feeling greatly disappointed that she did not find
him. Returning to the station she finally took her seat
in the car which was to carry her to her husband, a happier
woman than when she left him,—happier because
she believed, after what Annie had told her, that Jack
loved her still, and this lightened every dark spot in her
life. She might have changed her mind could she have
read his thoughts as he sat awaiting the arrival of one of
the firm and watching her train as it disappeared from
view. He had no suspicion that she was in it, but he
was thinking of her and his call at her house, and was glad
that with his thoughts of her now there was neither bitterness
nor regret for the past. Once she had filled his
heart so completely that he would have given his life for
her, but she had gone from it, leaving it empty and ready
for another occupant. Just when it came to him that
<em>Annie</em> was the sweetest and dearest and loveliest little woman
in all the world he could not tell. But it had come,
and it seemed to him that he had always loved her,—not
as he did Fanny, but that she had always been necessary
to him,—that when Fanny’s beauty and teasing coquetry
were stirring him to the very depths, Annie’s gentleness
had acted as a counter irritant, soothing and quieting him
and bringing out the best there was in him. It was weeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>since he had seen her, but he had carried her image with
him as she was that night he parted from her and kissed
her on the forehead. Something in her eyes had made
him think that he was more to her, perhaps, than the
brother he had called himself, and all through his travels
in Colorado and Utah and Texas he had been revolving
in his mind the expediency of asking her to be his wife,
and had built many castles for the future which began to
look fair and bright to him again, with Annie as his guiding-star.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shall see her to-night and settle it,” he thought,
while he watched Fanny’s train until the last wreath of
smoke disappeared in the distant woods.</p>

<p class='c014'>He could better afford to marry now than he could
two years ago, when nearly everything he had was expended
upon his house, which he had finally decided to
sell. His business over he started for Lovering, which
he reached at the same hour Fanny had on the day of her
arrival. His first thought was to go at once to The Elms.
Then he concluded to wait until later when Annie was sure
to be alone. Something, he scarcely knew what, prompted
him to take The Plateau on his way. Possibly it was
to see if there still lingered in his heart any feeling of regret
that the hopes which once clustered around the spot
had been so cruelly blighted. He reached it about dark
and as he walked around it, it seemed to him more than
ever like a tomb in which a part of his life was buried.
He always kept one key with him, while Annie had the
other. Entering the house at last he went through the
rooms one after another until he came to the bridal chamber.
Even here there was no longing in his heart for the
woman who had so cruelly betrayed him. It was there
his love for her had received its death blow, and he looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>around him as we look at the grave of a friend years after
the friend was buried there. Suddenly he started as his
eyes became accustomed to the dim light. The bed was
tumbled,—the pillows were displaced,—the shams were
crumpled. Somebody had lain there,—not quietly, but
restlessly, as if in pain, or great excitement. Who was
it, and how did they get in? He examined every door and
window below. Everything was secure, and in some perplexity
he left the place and walked rapidly to The Elms.
Again there was a bright fire on the hearth in the dining-room,
with the round tea-table before it, and again Annie
was sitting beside it, very pretty in her brown dress, the
shade of her eyes and hair. Rachel had brought her a
half-opened rose, which had grown on a bush Phyllis had
been tending in her kitchen, and Annie had fastened it
on her bosom, thereby adding to the brightness of her appearance.
She had spent a lonely day with Fanny gone
and no message from Jack, who was probably still far
away. Rachel had brought in her supper and she had dismissed
the girl, preferring to be alone. She was not
hungry, and was sitting with her feet on the fender and
her hands clasped behind her head and looking into the
fire so intent upon her thoughts that she did not hear the
opening or closing of the door, nor the step on the floor
as Jack crept up very cautiously until he stood looking
down upon her partially upturned face as her head rested
on the back of her chair. It was a very fair face,—a
pure, honest, innocent face, where nothing unwomanly
had ever written a line. It was just the face a good man
would like to kiss, and Jack did kiss it, not once but
many times, as he stooped over her and put his big warm
hands under her chin and drew her nearer to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>With a cry she bounded to her feet and looked at him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>with crimson cheeks and a light in her face such as he
had never seen in Fanny’s face when she was the kindest
to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Jack, how did you get in and I not hear you?”
she said, and then her eyes fell under something she saw
in his and understood.</p>

<p class='c014'>He held her hand and had one arm around her when
Rachel came in to clear the table. The girl was young
and knew the signs, and hurried out with the tea things,
telling Phyllis that “Mas’r Jack had done come and was
sparkin’ Miss Annie, who snugged up to him as if she
liked it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“In course she likes it, and I thanks de good Lord
who has brung it to pass on account of my rasslin’
so much in prar that it might come,” Phyllis said, never
doubting that she had been instrumental in moving the
Almighty to bring about what she so much desired.
“Don’t you go anigh, nor make a speck of noise, for dis
is a solemn occasion,” she said to Rachel, restraining her
in every way and herself walking in her stocking feet lest
she should disturb the couple, who would scarcely have
heard a cannon had it been fired in the lane.</p>

<p class='c014'>Leading Annie to the couch where he could hold her in
his arms better than if she sat in one chair and he in
another, Jack told his love in a straightforward way and
asked her to be his wife.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot offer you the same kind of love I gave to
Fanny,” he said. “That began in my boyhood and
was like the fruit which ripens early, with a blight upon it.
You know how it died, but not how dead it is, or how
another more healthful love has sprung up for the dear
little girl who was always better suited to me than Fanny.
Don’t speak yet,” he continued, as he saw Annie about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>to protest. “I have had time to think it over among the
Rockies;—on the plains and prairies of the west and under
the southern skies. The past has always been with
me, and I have never for a moment forgotten what Fanny
was to have been to me. If I had not lost my faith in
God I should have prayed to die, but I had made myself
believe that if there were a God He did not care for me,
and I was not willing to go unbidden into His presence.
Always in my darkest moments I seemed to see <em>you</em>, pitying
and comforting me as you did that dreadful night.
At first your face was shadowy,—then it began to clear,
until now it stands out before me as the dearest, sweetest
face in the world. Sweetest because of the truth and
goodness showing in every feature, and dearest because it
is the face of my wife that is to be.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was taking things for granted and kissing the face
he thought so sweet, until it was as red as the rose which
Annie wore and which became fearfully crumpled as the
love-making went on.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Jack,” Annie said, when at last she could get a
chance, “Oh, Jack, you frighten me so, and Fanny was
here yesterday, and left this morning. I don’t quite believe
she would like to have you say all this to me. She
is happier in knowing that you remember her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do remember her,” Jack replied. “I think of her
every day,—but that has nothing to do with my love for
you. She has gone out of my life as completely as if she
were dead. Why shouldn’t she? What have I to do with
a married woman? You say she has been here? Tell me
about it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Very briefly Annie told him of Fanny’s visit, saying that
she left that morning.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then she must have been in the train I watched till it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>was out of sight. I should like to have seen her. She
is a very grand lady by this time, I suppose,” Jack said,
and then told of his call at the house in Washington,
speaking as indifferently as he would have spoken of an
ordinary acquaintance. There could be no more doubt
that the old love was dead than that the new was in all
its freshness and vigor and would not be denied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have not answered me yet,” Jack said at last.
“I want to hear you say you love me, and I shall know
it is as true as the everlasting hills.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Jack,” Annie said. “If you are perfectly sure
you want me, I will be your wife. I believe I have loved
you all my life.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He had his arms around her again and was showering
kisses upon her face, when Rachel, curious to know how
matters were progressing, peered cautiously in and then
tiptoed back to the kitchen, her eyes like saucers as she
said, “He’s gone done it, sho’; he’s squeezin’ her,—oh,
my. Lem’ me show you,” and she experimented on
Phyllis, who shook her off, saying, “Git ’long wid ye.
Dat ar’ no way to do it. When I’se young an’ Josiah
came cross de hemp fields courtin’ me, he got on his
knees, an’ I done sot in his lap, an’ oh, my Lor’, de good
times till he took de cholera an’ died an’ lef’ me a widdy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, dat’s long ’go. We’s more refined sense de wah,
and spark different,—more like white uns,” Rachel replied,
with the air of one who was skilled in love-making as practiced
“sense de wah.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was late that night before Jack left The Elms. He
had so much to say, and his love kept growing so fast for
the quiet little girl, who was content to sit with her head
upon his arm and her hand in his and listen while he told
her over and over again how dear she was to him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>planned their future. Fortune was favoring him in many
ways, and although he might never be rich he should be
able to surround her with every comfort and relieve her
of all care.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Would you like to live at The Plateau?” he asked,
and Annie answered quickly, “No, no; not there. I
might get jealous of Fanny. Let us stay here where I
was born, and keep the dear old home for them all to
come to, Paul and Katy and Carl. I can’t help thinking
he will yet be one of us,—and Fanny, too. Something
tells me she’ll come by and by.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Just what Jack thought of Fanny’s coming he did not
say, but he planned with Annie to sell the house on The
Plateau with all its belongings to a gentleman from Richmond
who had spoken of buying it. He urged a speedy
marriage,—the sooner the better,—although it would be
hard to tear himself away for the long trips he might
have to take at intervals for several months and possibly
a year. But Annie said “No; we must wait till you are
through traveling. I could not bear to have you leave
me alone after I was your wife. And then I want Katy
and Paul here when we are married. Let us say next
Thanksgiving. I shall not be quite an old maid then.
I am only twenty-eight now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She laughed merrily as she glanced up at him with a
look which reminded him of Fanny, it was so bright and
coquettish. Was that why he kissed her so passionately?
He didn’t think so. He believed every spark of his old
love dead, or he would not have talked of a new. Annie
was not as beautiful as Fanny, but she was very lovely in
her mature womanhood, and would never fatigue and
worry and bewilder him as Fanny had done in her varying
moods. He was supremely happy, and when alone that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>night in his room at the hotel he knelt down for the first
time since the morning two years before when he had
made so many good resolves, and thanked God in so many
words for taking Fanny from him and giving him Annie
instead.</p>

<p class='c014'>This telegram was brought to Annie one morning just
after Jack had left her for Richmond. For a moment
everything around her was chaos, as she sat with the
message in her hands trying to collect her thoughts, which
turned into a strange channel. Col. Errington was dead.
Fanny was free, and loved Jack as well, or better, than she
ever did. And Jack? What of him? Now that the
barrier was removed, would his first great love revive,
kindled again into flame by his pity for Fanny, and the
wiles she would surely practice upon him, given the
chance?</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, oh no!” Annie said at last. “It is unjust to
Jack and a wrong to Fanny.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then as she read again the “Come at once,” she began
to plan for her journey, the first she had ever taken
alone. It was too late to go that day, and she must take
the early train the next morning and wait in Richmond
as Fanny had done.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>“I shall telegraph Jack to meet me there,” she
thought, wondering how he would look when she told him
Col. Errington was dead.</p>

<p class='c014'>The little jealous stab would intrude in spite of her, and
when, the next morning, summoned by the telegram he
had received from her the day before, Jack met her at the
station, she told him the news in a breath.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Jack, Col. Errington is dead. Fanny is a widow
and has sent for me,” she gasped, and then looked up at
him, much as a criminal in the dock looks at the judge
when receiving sentence.</p>

<p class='c014'>But what she feared she might see was not there. Jack
was startled, but not greatly surprised, as he recalled
what he had heard of the Colonel’s condition in Washington.
The words “Fanny is a widow” made no other
impression than to present her to his mind as sorrowful
and alone. He knew nothing of her married life, but
supposed she had been comparatively happy, inasmuch
as she had her heart’s desire,—money. Naturally, she
was  very desolate now in the first stages of her grief, and
in his great kind heart he was sorry for her, but more
sorry for the timid girl clinging so closely to him as she
asked many questions about her journey,—must she
change cars and did he think they would run off the
track, and what should she do when she got there if there
was no one to meet her. He told her that she did not
change cars,—that the train would not run off the track,
and there would be some one to meet her if, as she
said, she had telegraphed that she was coming. Then he
made her sit down while he went for her ticket, and when
he came back to her he held up <em>two</em>, instead of one.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jack,” she exclaimed, “<em>are</em> you going with me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, little woman. I thought it would please you,”
he replied, taking her arm to lead her to the train.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>She was very glad, and still the little stab would intrude,
as she wondered how much he was actuated by a wish to
see Fanny again, and how much by a desire to please her.
The train was a slow one and this day it was unusually
slow, so that it was late when it drew into the station in
Washington. Half the way at least Jack had sat with his
arm partly around her, and once, overcome with fatigue,
she had fallen asleep, and when she awoke had found her
head lying on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh-h, excuse me. What must the people think?”
she said, blushing crimson, as if guilty of an indiscretion.
Jack laughed and answered, “They’ll think you are my
wife or sweetheart, and who cares if they do? Put your
head down again. You look tired.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Annie sat bolt upright the rest of the way, and as
far from Jack as she could get. When they reached
Washington he took her to the waiting-room, while he
went to look for the Errington carriage, if it were there.
With a little inquiry he found it,—a very grand turnout,
with its shining black horses and shining harness and
shining driver in livery, who said he was sent for Miss
Hathern.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come on; it’s all right,” Jack said to Annie, leading
her to the carriage and seeing her inside. Then, greatly
to her surprise, he put himself half way in and kissed her,
saying, “Good-bye, darling. Write me to-morrow, and
don’t stay longer than you can help.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, Jack, arn’t you going with me?” Annie cried,
and he replied, “Why, no. I only came to see you safely
here and shall go back to-night. The train leaves in half
an hour. If I could be of any service to Fanny I’d go, of
course; but she has plenty to help her. Give her my kind
regards, and say I am sorry for her. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>He kissed her again, closed the door, and motioned
the coachman to drive on.</p>

<hr class='c021'>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. Errington wishes me to bring you to her directly,”
the maid said to Annie, who, cold and tired and bewildered
by the elegance and grandeur which met her eyes on
every side, followed on up the wide stairway to the room
where Fanny sat, her face very pale and her eyes very
large and bright, but with no particular semblance of grief,
except the closed shutters and the deep black border on
the handkerchief she held in her hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Annie, I am so glad you have come at last. Adam
was gone so long I was afraid there might have been an
accident, and you all alone and not accustomed to traveling,”
she said, holding out her arms and only half rising
from her chair.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The train was late, but I was not alone. Jack came
with me,” Annie replied, and instantly Fanny’s whole
demeanor changed.</p>

<p class='c014'>In her own house, and a widow just bereaved, she had
not at first seemed just as she did in Lovering with the old
familiar objects around her and her head in Annie’s lap.
She was a grander, more dignified lady, as befitted her surroundings,
and Annie had noticed it and thought it quite
appropriate. But at the mention of Jack she was Fanny
again, and springing up exclaimed, “Jack came with you!
How kind in him. Where is he? Why didn’t he come
here at once?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie explained that he only came because she was
timid and foolish,—that he was going back that night, and
had sent his kind regards to Fanny and said he was sorry
for her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is <em>not</em> going back to-night if there is time to reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>him. I want to see him. It is perfectly proper for him
to come here,—the only male friend I have in the world,
and just like a brother,” Fanny said, her hands shaking
with excitement as she touched the bell and summoned
her maid, Marie.</p>

<p class='c014'>Adam was ordered to return to the station as fast as
possible,—find the gentleman who came with Miss Hathern
and bring him to the house.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meanwhile, Annie had removed her hat and cloak and
drawn up to the fire in the grate.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are cold,” Fanny said, “and hungry, too. Dinner
will be served as soon as Jack gets here, and I shall be so
glad to have some one at the table with me. I have
scarcely eaten since—George—died.” She hesitated a
little and then went on steadily, “It was very sudden at
the last and I was sorry when I saw him dead and knew
how he wanted to live.” Annie looked at her quickly,
and she continued, “I know you think me hard, but there
is no need for me to pretend to be heartbroken with you,
who know everything. There was no real affection between
George and me, although we were getting on better
of late, and since my visit to Lovering we have been very
friendly and familiar, kissing each other every morning
and every night. He was glad to see me when I came
home, and only said one mean thing. Jack called,—perhaps
you know,—and left his card. George showed it to
me and said, ‘I dare say you’d rather have missed your
visit home than him.’ I replied, ‘A great deal rather.’
He didn’t swear at me, but he did at his foot and went on
to say, ‘You may have a chance soon to get your old lover
back, if the doctor is right in his diagnosis. He says there
is danger of this confounded rheumatism attacking my
heart if I allow myself to get excited as I do at times. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>was swearing pretty loud at Clary and my face was purple,
I suppose. So the easiest way to get rid of me is to worry
and annoy me and rouse me up.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was very angry, but did not say a word. There was
something in his face I had not seen there before.  A
change for the worse and it deepened every day as the
disease crept up to the region of his heart. I was as kind
to him as I could be, and he wanted me with him all the
time. Once after I had read to him an hour and brushed
his hair, he put both his poor swollen hands up to my face
and said, ‘You are very good to me, Fanny, and I have
cared more for you than you thought. I have been hard
and mean, but when I get well we will begin again.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“That touched me more than anything he had ever
done, and I said I had been mean, too, and kissed him,
and I am so glad to remember it now he is dead. It was
awfully sudden at the last. He seemed better and wanted
to go down to dinner with me, and asked me to put on one
of my pretty dresses from Worth’s and let him see me in
it. I did so and walked back and forth in his room, while
he commented and admired. Then I went to dinner and
was nearly through when Marie came running in and told
me he was dying. I reached him in time for just one look
from his eyes, and such a look, as if he wanted to tell me
something. Then he was gone. I wish it had been different
with us and that I could feel as a widow ought to feel.
But I can’t. There is a lump in my throat when I think of
George, and I have been in and looked at his dead face
many times, and staid there once half an hour trying to get
up a widow’s feeling. I am sorry that I did not make him
happier, but I can’t cry, and don’t want to. I shall enact
all the proprieties,—wind myself in crape and wear a
widow’s cap, which will be horridly unbecoming, and shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>hanker after all my new Paris gowns I was to wear this
winter, and which are of no use to me now. Hark! Isn’t
that the carriage I heard? I wonder if Jack came.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She ran to the window to look out. Jack did not come.
Adam had reached the station just as the train for Richmond
had gone, and, greatly disappointed, Fanny went
with Annie to dinner, which was served as Annie had never
seen a dinner served before, for Fanny exacted her pound
of flesh and never omitted any ceremony, although she
dined alone. She had married for money and position and
style, and she made the most of them, finding in them
some compensation for the emptiness of her domestic life.
For the dead man in his costly casket she had no love.
He had thwarted her at every point and kept her down,
and now that the iron hand was withdrawn she could not
help a feeling of relief, although sorry for all that had
been unpleasant between them as man and wife. He had
been far more in fault than she, but now that he was gone
she could recall many a time when she might have done
differently and provoked him less. But he was dead, and
she was not going to wear her life out with regrets for
what could not be helped, she said to Annie, when, after
dinner was served, she sat again in her room and talked
first of George and then of Jack, and quite as much of the
latter as of the former. Twice Annie opened her lips to
tell her of her engagement, but each time something
Fanny said checked her. “I’ll wait,” she thought, with an
uneasy feeling that such news might affect Fanny more
than the death of her husband.</p>

<p class='c014'>The funeral was private, and Fanny, wound in crape, as
she said she should be, looked the embodiment of grief,
and felt a sharp pang of pain and remorse when her husband
was carried from the house he would never enter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>again. It was hers now with everything pertaining to it,
for she was sole heir to all his large fortune. The family
lawyer told her this and read her the will when all the
paraphernalia of death were removed, the blinds opened,
and the wintry sun was shining brightly into the handsome
rooms. The will was made while Fanny was in Lovering,
and when she heard it and knew that everything was hers
unconditionally she covered her face with her hands and
cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was so kind in him,” she said to Annie when they
were alone. “I didn’t expect it, and I don’t deserve it.”
Then she began to plan what she would do with so much
money. Annie was to have some, and Katy and Paul,
and Jack, if he would take it. Did Annie think he would?
“No, never; don’t insult him that way,” Annie exclaimed
so energetically that Fanny looked at her in surprise, but
with no suspicion of the truth.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again and many times thereafter Annie tried to tell her,
but as often as she tried something held her back. A
little shadow was darkening her horizon, and it increased
as the days went on and she gained a clearer insight to
Fanny’s real feelings. She was a model widow, doing
everything she ought to do, secluding herself from the
world, seeing very few who called, wearing her weeds with
a tolerably good grace, except the cap, and talking a good
deal of George, but far more of Jack. And Annie, listening
to her, felt herself grow sick with a morbid fear
as she thought “she loves him, and—perhaps—perhaps—now
that she is free, his love for her will come again, and
I shall be left desolate.”</p>

<p class='c014'>More than one fierce battle the brave little woman
fought with herself when alone in her room. If Jack turned
to Fanny could she bear it and make no sign, she asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>herself over and over again, while her heart ached as if
the thing she so much dreaded had come to pass. In her
calmer moments she could remember how wholly Jack
seemed to love her now, and that gave her comfort and
hope. “But if he is mistaken,—if as time passes and he
meets Fanny, as he must, and falls again under the spell of
her beauty, I shall know it and give him up,” she thought.
“Better so than share a divided heart. That I could not
bear. I’ll not tell Fanny of our engagement yet. I’ll
give Jack a chance and trust him until I see some sign.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a long letter from Jack the next day, full of
love and tenderness, with a kind message for Fanny, who
fortunately did not hear the postman and thus knew nothing
of the letter which Annie read and hid in her bosom like a
guilty thing, blushing when her sister looked at her and
turning away as if afraid her treasure might be snatched
from her. Fanny had no suspicion. She only thought
how pretty Annie was growing in her old age, as she laughingly
called their twenty-eight years. Once she led her
to the glass and said, “See how much younger you look
than I do, especially in this disfiguring cap. I won’t wear
it,” and she tossed the offending head-gear upon the bed.
Even without it there seemed a disparity of years between
them, for over Annie’s face no stormy passions had ever
swept like those which had written faint lines about Fanny’s
eyes and mouth and frosted some threads of her hair
just where it showed the most. Annie’s was soft and
brown and glossy as a child’s, and the light in her eyes
was steadfast and clear and always the same, except when
she thought of losing Jack. Then it grew suddenly misty
with the tears she kept forcing back.</p>

<p class='c014'>Several times as the weeks went by Fanny wondered why
Jack didn’t write, and once she suggested writing to him and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>inviting him to come to Washington and accompany Annie
home when she was ready to go. But Annie saw through
the ruse and dissuaded her from it, saying she felt quite
equal to making the journey alone. She had received
several letters from Jack and had always been fortunate
enough to take them directly from the postman or Marie,
and Fanny, who staid a great deal in her room knew nothing
of them. On the whole, Annie’s life in Washington
was not very hilarious. She took several drives, visited
the Capitol, the Treasury, the Patent Office and Smithsonian,
and attended a reception at the White House, and
received a few calls. But the ladies who came in velvets
and furs and carriages were not like the people of Lovering,
who ran in informally morning or evening or at any
time. She missed the familiarity and friendliness of her
home life, and after staying six weeks with her sister she
announced her intention of going back to Lovering.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first Fanny objected, then suddenly changed her
mind and seemed rather to accelerate her sister’s departure
than to retard it. Annie had told her of Jack’s intention
to sell the house on The Plateau, and that had
troubled her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell him not to do it. Maybe I shall live there yet,”
she had said more than once, and on the morning when Annie
left her she referred to it again, adding, as she kissed
Annie good-bye, “If I find this big house too ghostly I
shall come home. You may see me at any time. Give
my love to all the people, and—yes,—to Jack, too. Why
not? Tell him I think him mean never to have sent me
any message, except the one you brought me the night
you came. He might at least have sent me a card of
sympathy for the sake of Auld Lang Syne.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She didn’t look as if she needed much sympathy, as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>stood in her black gown, tall and graceful, with a healthful
light in her eyes, a smile on her lips, and color in her
cheeks to which the roses were coming back; and it was
this picture of her which Annie carried in her mind as the
train moved out of Washington and on into the rather
desolate Virginia country through which the road to Richmond
passes.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter XII.—Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>GOING HOME.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t want to be a great lady in society. I’d rather
live all my life in plain Lovering,” Annie thought as she
reviewed the incidents of her visit, and then her mind
turned upon Jack, who was getting impatient for her return.
She knew he was in Richmond and was wondering if he
would meet her, when the cars suddenly stopped. Something
was the matter with the engine which could not be
remedied at once. They were near Fredericksburg and
a few of the passengers walked to that place, but Annie
kept her seat, varying the monotony occasionally by short
excursions into the woods. It was three hours before they
were ready to start and then they moved but slowly. All
hope of connecting with the Lovering train was given up,
and Annie was beginning to feel very desolate and to
wonder what she should do in a strange city and alone,
when they stopped again for water. She was cold and
hungry, and there were tears in her eyes as she looked out
upon the darkening landscape and thought of Jack and
wished he was with her. Leaning her elbow on the window
stool she was about to indulge in a good cry when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>somebody came up behind her, put both hands on her
shoulders, joined them together under her chin, drew her
face upwards and backwards and kissed her!</p>

<p class='c014'>“I knew you by the little red wing on your brown hat,”
the somebody said, and Jack was sitting beside her.</p>

<p class='c014'>He had a few hours off, he explained, and had come to
meet her, knowing that the train stopped for water at this
station, where he had waited during what seemed a little
eternity.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I knew you’d be hungry and I foraged round till I
found a sandwich, a fried cake and some apples,” he continued,
putting a paper parcel in her lap and getting possession
of one of her hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was not cold any more, or very hungry either, although
she managed to make way with a sandwich and
part of a fried cake whose age she could not well guess.</p>

<p class='c014'>Jack was with her. He had come to meet her. His
face was close to hers,—his arm was around her notwithstanding
that she told him people were looking on, just
as she had told him on their journey up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let them look,” he said, glancing around. “There’s
nobody behind us but an old man, and two old women, and
a young one who would like to be in your place.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he asked her about her stay in Washington and
made some inquiries about Fanny as naturally as if she
had been the most ordinary acquaintance. It was eight
o’clock when they reached Richmond and Jack took Annie
for the night to a friend of his. The next afternoon he
accompanied her to Lovering, where Phyllis was ready for
her. Jack had telegraphed that Annie was coming, and
the old negress stood in the door, a new turban on her
head, and her face shining as she welcomed her mistress
home.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>“Oh, it is so good to be here,” Annie said, as she let
Phyllis remove her cloak and hat and then sank into the
easy chair before the fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>The round table was brought out again for supper with
the best silver and china, and Phyllis waited and repeated
all the gossip of the town, while Annie listened with more
interest than she had felt for anything since she left home.
Lovering was the place to live in and Fanny was welcome
to her grandeur and the society of which she thought so
much. By and by Jack came in and then it was heaven
with him beside her, talking of their future with almost as
much enthusiasm as he had once talked to her of that to-morrow
which had never dawned for him. He was going
north soon on a tour which might be extended into three
or four months. This was to be the last, for when he returned
his place was to be filled by another man and he
was to become partner in the firm and open a branch of
the business in Lovering.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then we shall be married. There is no reason why
we should wait any longer,” he said, kissing the face resting
upon his shoulder as he talked. “I thought I was
sure to sell the house on The Plateau, but the man has
changed his mind. Someone else, however, will want it,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie was silent for a moment, and then she said,
“Fanny bade me tell you not to sell it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why! What possible interest can she have in it?”
Jack asked in some surprise, and Annie replied “She
said she might live there yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>Fanny</em> live at The Plateau! Impossible! What does
she mean? Didn’t you tell her of our engagement?”
Jack said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” Annie answered falteringly.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>“Why not?” Jack demanded in surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hesitating a little Annie replied, “I hardly know. I
tried to tell her two or three times, but something always
stopped me, Jack,” and Annie began to finger the buttons
on his coat, counting them to herself as she did so,
“I do not believe Fanny ever cared very much for her
husband.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I never supposed she did, but what has that to do
with your not telling her?” Jack said, imprisoning the
hand fingering his buttons.</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie had not intended letting him know of the foolish
fancy which had possessed her, but she could not very
well help it now, and she continued: “She did care for you
very much, and you for her, and if you were to see her,
now that she is free, you might—perhaps—Oh, Jack,—you
might care for her more than for me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie’s voice was not at all steady, and so low that
Jack bent down to listen until his face touched hers. He
heard her though and understood her perfectly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Annie,” he said, “Is it possible you do not know
how dead is my love for Fanny,—dead and buried, and the
ground above its grave stamped down so hard that it can
never rise again. Don’t let that trouble you. Fanny’s
freedom is nothing to me. <em>She</em> is nothing to me except a
memory,—and your sister,—my sister, too, by and by.
Is my little girl satisfied on that score?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was more than satisfied, and the next morning began
a letter to Fanny in which she meant to tell of her
engagement. Then, moved by some unaccountable impulse,
she tore the letter up and wrote another, in which
there was no word of Jack. At the end of two weeks
Jack left for his last trip. Before going, however, he
heard from the real estate agent in Richmond who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>charge of his house on The Plateau that some one wished
to buy it and had offered more than the price at which it
was held. “Will you sell it?” he wrote. Jack’s answer
was in the affirmative, and within a few days the house on
The Plateau had passed from his possession into that of a
Mr. Emery, whose instructions were that the keys should
remain where they were, and that Jack should see that the
place was properly cared for until such time as the owner
came to claim his property. Just when that would be the
agent did not know, nor did Jack particularly care. The
house was off his hands, and he had in its stead a sum of
money much larger than he had ever thought to realize
from it. One key was to be left with Annie, as it always
had been,—the other Jack kept, and together they went
through the house the day before Jack started for the
north. If Jack felt any regret for the past he did not
manifest it, and stood apparently unmoved in <em>Our Room</em>
and looked at the medallion smiling upon him and said
how much it was like what Fanny was years ago. And
he sat in the bay window where he was to have sat with
Fanny and talked of the fine view to be had from it as unconcernedly
as if he had not once felt all hope dying out
from his future and leaving it black as night. It was very
bright now, as with Annie at his side he gave one last look
at the house which he had built, and then left it with no
wish that things were otherwise.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next day he went away and Annie was alone, but
not lonely. She was too happy for that, and there were
too many bright anticipations of the future when Jack
should return. There were frequent letters from him full
of the tender words a woman likes to hear from the man
she loves. There were letters also from Katy and Miss
Errington, who were in Egypt when the news of the Colonel’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>death reached them. Letters, too, from Paul, who
was still in Paris and improving rapidly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The poor little old Monsieur is dead,” he wrote.
“Had a cancer which made Madame so sick that she
staid a heap in Paris at the hotel with us. Sam understands
a good deal now, and says she said some of the
flattest things to Carl about a lonely life and <em>trist</em> and
<em>ah—me</em>, or something. Sam remembers the words and
hunts them up in the dictionary, where he cannot always
find them on account of the <em>tense</em>, you know. Then he
asks somebody what they mean. Carl went to little Monsieur’s
funeral. She sent for him, and Sam said, ‘I tell
you I’m <em>fachey</em> about it.’ I think he meant <em>mad</em>, and unknown
to Carl he went, too, and saw the doings. It was
an awful big funeral, and a grand chateau, and Madame
was all in black and hystericky and leaned on Carl, who,
Sam said, looked as if he wished she wouldn’t. She is
here now, and her heart is broken all to pieces with no
one in the world to comfort her. Carl tries all he can,
and sits with her a good deal, and once they drove out to
the Bois and Sam said he should give Carl a piece of his
mind. He did give it to him, and asked him what the
folks would say if they knew he was flirting with an old
French widow. Carl was mad and told Sam he was getting
out of his place; but he don’t sit with her now so
much, and says he shall leave Paris as soon as it is safe
for me to go, and Sam says he is going to ferret out <em>who</em>
the woman is, as he don’t believe she’s first class.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was also a letter from Sam himself, containing
nearly every French word or phrase which he had picked
up. There was a good deal about the “widder with yeller
hair” who was trying to make a fool of Carl, and Annie was
entreated to write him on the subject. But she thought it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>wiser not to interfere. She had faith in Carl, and did not
believe that a woman such as Madame was described to
be could hold him long or do him material harm.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every week there came a deep black-bordered letter
from Fanny, who was very lonely, and reviled the practice
of shutting one’s self up like a nun because a friend
was dead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If anybody needs fresh air,” she wrote, “and glimpses
of the world and diversion it is the mourner, sitting
behind closed doors, when there is so much that is bright
and gay outside, and I tell you I shall not stand it much
longer, Grundy or no Grundy. I am like a bird shut up in
a cage and longing for the green woods it can see but not
reach. I will reach them, however. There are times
when we should be a law to ourselves, and that is what I
am going to do.”</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter XIII.—Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>A LAW TO HERSELF.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>Three weeks after the receipt of this letter Annie had
been up to the house on The Plateau, which was still untenanted,
nor did anyone know when the new proprietor
would take possession. Money had been forwarded with
a request that if Mr. Fullerton were not there Miss Hathern
would see that the house and grounds were kept in
perfect order, as the owner might arrive at any time.
Some flowering shrubs and choice plants were also sent,
with the message that Annie could arrange them as she
liked. Mr. Emery could trust Miss Hathern’s taste from
what he had heard of her. No mention had ever been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>made of Mrs. Emery, who, if she existed, was more of a
myth than her husband. In Jack’s absence Annie had
attended to everything, and the grounds at The Plateau
were very beautiful in the warmth of the May sunshine
as she went over them that afternoon, thinking what a
lovely spot it was and how happy one might be there.
For herself, she preferred her old home at The Elms.
That needed painting and renovating, but Jack had said
to her when she proposed attacking it, “Wait, and we will
fix it together. There are several improvements I have
in mind which I know you will like.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On her return from The Plateau Annie took the path
through the woods, coming up to the house from the lane
and past the old negro quarters to the dining-room door,
where the expressman was unloading four immense trunks,—one
a huge Saratoga, the others less pretentious and
covered with foreign placards. Her first thought was
that Katy had come, but the tall woman in black, with a
veil which came nearly to her feet, was not Katy, but
Fanny, who was giving directions and making herself
quite at home.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why Fan,” Annie exclaimed, “where did you come
from?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Washington. Where do you suppose?” Fanny replied,
following her trunks up stairs to the room she had
taken for herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Removing her bonnet and fanning herself with it, she
said, “I’ve come to spend the summer. I hope you are
glad to see me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course I am,” Annie replied, and she continued,
“I staid in that great lonesome house until I couldn’t
stand it another minute. You have no idea what it is to
be a fashionable widow, hedged round with custom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>Can’t go anywhere or do anything without shocking the
world. If I were poor with a lot of children and had to
work for their living and mine, I should get out among
people and see things and forget myself. But I am rich,
and must follow the fashion or be talked about as heartless.
It is dreadful moping at home until every room
seems haunted, and you fancy you hear ghost steps on the
stairs and behind you and beside you and everywhere,
until you feel it would be a relief to hear George swearing
again at Clary, or even at yourself, if he had been in
the habit of doing so. I could not endure it, so I packed
up and came home, where I can rest and do as I please,
and wear what I please. I am so tired of this heavy veil,
which pulls my head back, and gives me a feeling as if
George were stepping on my gown and tripping me up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As she talked she was removing the veil, which she threw
upon the bed saying, “There, I am done with that. I
can mourn just as well under a short one which does not
jerk my head and make it ache. Once I thought I’d bring
Marie, then I changed my mind. What do I want of a
French maid here? I shall be glad to wait upon myself
and you, too. Why, I believe I’d like to go into the
kitchen and help Phyllis scrub and wash. It would be a
change from having so many servants, with all the show
and ceremony I once thought so fine, and which as Mrs.
Errington, of Washington, I must keep up. Bah! <em>Husks</em>,
the whole of it! I’m like the prodigal son come home
again, with this difference, he came empty-handed,
while I come rich, with no elder brother to be jealous.
And I am so glad to be here,—to be Fan Hathern again.
I wish they would call me that. Will the neighbors come
to see me, do you think? And where is Jack?”</p>

<p class='c014'>With that question Fanny sounded the key note of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>real reason for coming home. She had been bored to
death in Washington and very lonely in the midst of her
splendor. She was naturally very social and would have
liked her house full of company. To be a widow in deep
mourning, just bereaved, with all the restraints it implied,
was intolerable, especially as she knew that at heart she
was not the mourner she seemed to be. Had it been
Jack for whom the crape was worn all the world would
have lost its brightness, and her widow’s weeds would
have but poorly told of her desolation. But Jack was
alive, and she believed cared for her still. She had
treated him shamefully, and it was quite <i><span lang="fr">en règle</span></i> that she
should make the first advances towards a renewal of their
former friendship. She had never cared much for conventionalities.
She was a law unto herself, and if she
chose to go to Lovering she had a right to do so, and
there was no one to object. She meant to be very circumspect
and not give the people food for gossip. George
had been dead six months;—these would soon stretch into
a year, and then——; she did not put into words what
then,—but she had no doubt of it, and never had the future
looked so bright to her as on her journey to Lovering,
during which she was constantly assuring herself
that there was no impropriety in what she was doing, and
that if by reason of it she saw Jack at intervals and kept
herself in his mind it was but the natural sequence of
things.</p>

<p class='c014'>There had been several days of rain and mist, but this
had passed and the sun was shining bright and warm, and
Fanny had never seen the house and grounds look pleasanter
or more attractive than they did that afternoon
when she drove down the avenue and began to feel a slight
misgiving as to what Annie would say to her coming so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>unceremoniously and taking possession. Annie’s welcome
was reassuring, and Fanny’s spirits expanded wonderfully
in the atmosphere and freedom of home, and she felt the
burden of society’s restraints slipping away from her. She
had hoped that Jack might be in town and that she should
see him that night, and in fancy she had gone over many
times what she should say to him and what he would say
to her. There would naturally be a little constraint on
his side at first, but that would soon wear off and he would
be the Jack of old in all except loverlike attentions.
These she did not expect or desire at once. “I am not
entirely lost to all sense of propriety,” she was thinking
when Annie came upon her, and for awhile turned her
thoughts in another channel.</p>

<p class='c014'>To her question “Where is Jack?” Annie replied by
telling her of his long trip which might last some weeks
longer, or might be soon ended. The day was not quite
as bright after that and Fanny’s face was clouded a little,
but it soon cleared, and the next morning, save for her
weeds and the absence of bright color from her face, she
was the same light-hearted girl who used to flit about the
house, ruling it with her imperious ways, but doing it so
prettily that no one cared for the ruling. In less than
twenty-four hours she was mistress, and Annie yielded to
her and was glad to have her there, and the neighbors
called and made much of her and she returned their calls
and wore her short veil when she felt like it and when
she didn’t she left it off, and was as little like a disconsolate
widow as it was possible for one to be. In the house
on The Plateau she was greatly interested, asking many
questions about Mr. Emery none of which Annie could
answer. She did not even know where he lived. She
spent the money he sent for improvements to the best of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>her ability, and Fanny for the most part approved of what
she had done. A few changes in some of the shrubbery
she would suggest if the place were hers, she said, and as
it was not too late to make them they were made, with the
result of a better general effect. The Plateau had a great
fascination for Fanny, who went there very often, sometimes
staying for hours and sometimes just walking up to
it for exercise, she said. One day about the last of July
she was gone longer than usual and when she came back
she seemed in unusually high spirits, and sitting down to
the piano which she had not touched before began to sing
Bonny Doon, Jack’s favorite, which she was to have
played for him in the home she had destroyed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where do you suppose Jack is?” she asked, as she
rose from the piano. Then, before Annie could answer,
she continued: “I have half a mind to write him and tell
him to hurry, as I want to see him. Do you think it
would be improper?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It would depend upon your motive,” Annie replied
very quietly, and Fanny answered quickly, “I don’t know
that I have any motive, except an inexpressible longing
to see him and to know what he thinks of me. Annie,”
and Fanny grew very serious and breathed quickly as she
went on: “I love Jack just as well as I ever did, and I
want him to know it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Would you write it to him?” Annie asked, with
a calmness which surprised herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, no,—not exactly that; but something that
would give him a suspicion of the truth. You think it
unwomanly, I can see by your face,” she continued, and
Annie replied, “<em>I</em> would not do it for worlds, and your
husband so recently dead.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I tell you <em>that</em> does not count. Ours is an exceptional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>case,” Fanny said, with some asperity in tone and manner;
“and how often must I say that I do not care for
conventionalities. I am a law to myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t believe I’d take the law into my hands
in that way,” Annie said, resolving now to tell her sister
what she wished she had told her before.</p>

<p class='c014'>A caller interrupted her, and when the lady left Fanny
also disappeared and did not return for an hour or more.
Then her face had an anxious expression such as it sometimes
used to wear during the war when word came to
town that a company of soldiers was in the woods, or on
the distant plain. Supper was waiting for her, laid on
the back piazza where she liked to have it when the evening
was warm, as it was now. But she had no appetite.
The orange shortcake, with its rich cream, which Phyllis
had made expressly for her, was scarcely touched. She
was tired and had a headache, she said, and very soon
after sunset went to her room. Annie knew, however,
that she was not in bed, as she heard her walking back
and forth across the floor for a long time, occasionally
stopping for a few moments and then beginning again as
if too restless to keep still. When at last, at an earlier
hour than usual, Annie went to her room, the walking had
ceased, but there was a light shining over Fanny’s door
showing that she had not retired. It was a glorious
night, with the moon at its full and the air sweet with
the scent of flowers and the pines from the woods.
Throwing on a dressing-gown Annie had just sat down by
the window to enjoy the beauty of the scene, when there
was a tap on her door and Fanny came in habited for
bed, with a shawl thrown around her shoulders and her
long hair falling down her back. Annie had extinguished
the lamp, but the moon filled the room with light and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>showed plainly the whiteness of Fanny’s face and the
drawn look about her mouth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What ails you, Fan? What has happened?” Annie
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bringing a chair close to the window beside her sister,
Fanny replied, “<em>This</em> has happened. I am an idiot,—a
bold, shameless woman, who in being a law to herself
has made a fool of herself. I have written to Jack,—not
exactly a love letter, although it meant that, and he will
take it as such. What am I to do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie was too much surprised at first to reply; then
she said, “You have—written—a love letter to Jack!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I have,—or equivalent to that. I think it was
Satan tempted me, and now he is laughing at me for the
scrape he got me into,” Fanny said. “I have been considering
it for some time, arguing that there could be no
harm in it, and this afternoon I took pen, ink and paper
with me to The Plateau and wrote it <em>there</em>, in the window
where I was to watch for him. I said more than I
meant to when I began,—put it stronger, I mean,—and
offered him half or all of my money, if he wanted it. I
think the old Harry must have driven me on, I was so
anxious to finish it and get it posted. I directed to care
of the firm he is with in Richmond. On my way home I
dropped it in the letter box, and was so happy that, as you
will remember, I sat down and sang Bonny Doon because
Jack liked it, and what I had done seemed to bring him
nearer to me. Then to see what you would think of me
I finessed a little and suggested writing to him. You disapproved
and I was angry and thought you a prude, and
half suspected you had designs on Jack yourself. That
was the meanest part of it. While Mrs. Carter was calling
I kept thinking what I had done and it didn’t look to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>me as it had at first. I saw with your eyes, and something
told me Jack might see it that way, too. The fear
kept growing until I was nearly wild, and thought Mrs.
Carter would never be done telling what good and bright
children she had and be gone. I had thought of a way
out of my dilemma, if I were not too late and that woman
did not stay forever. She did stay and I was too late. I
went to the post office and said I’d like to withdraw the
letter I posted two hours ago. The mail was gone, the
postmaster said, and grinned at me impertinently, I
thought, as if he knew what letter I meant and thought
it queer that I should write to Jack. I know my face
was scarlet and it has burned ever since. Do you think
he will despise me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny’s voice was choked with tears as she made her
confession, and then putting her head in Annie’s lap cried
like a child. She had done a foolish thing, driven on to do
it by an impulse she did not try to resist and which impelled
her to write more than she had at first intended.
Jack was told how she had suffered for her treachery to
him and how, through all her suffering, it had been a comfort
to believe that he still cared for her, and that without
such belief she should have died.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps it is unwomanly in me to write this,” she
said, “but I cannot help it, and I am longing for the
time when I shall see you again. I shall know by your
face if you still care for me or not. If not, call me ‘Mrs.
Errington,’ if you do care, call me ‘Fanny,’ when you
first meet me, and I shall understand.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she spoke of her money,—more than she could
ever use,—and said nothing would please her better than
to give or loan a portion of it to him, if he wished to use
it in his business. She closed by signing herself “Yours
as always. Fanny.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>It was a letter that any man would understand, and
Fanny’s regret at having sent it was so bitter that Annie
tried to comfort her by saying that as Jack was constantly
moving from place to place he might not get it, especially
if, as was possible, he came home sooner than he had expected
to when he left. This was a straw, but Fanny
clung to it while Annie debated in her mind whether to
tell of her engagement as she ought to have done long
before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe it would kill her to tell her now,” she
thought. “I’ll wait and possibly—”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here the little sting, which she had thought gone forever
made itself felt. Possibly, when Jack knew from
Fanny herself that she loved him, and when he saw her
again he might regret he was bound to her, and then?—</p>

<p class='c014'>She could not answer any more than she could say
to Fanny, “Jack belongs to me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are cold,” she said at last as she saw Fanny
shiver and draw her shawl closer around her. “Go to
bed and trust Jack, who will do right, whatever happens.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But the shame of it,—the shame of it. You would
never have done it,” Fanny answered, as she rose slowly
and kissing Annie good-night went to her room.</p>

<p class='c014'>Neither of the sisters slept much, and Annie the least.
Regret that she had not told Fanny of her engagement
when she was in Washington, and a morbid dread of the
possible future, kept her awake long after midnight, and
both she and Fanny were tired and white when at a later
hour than usual they met at the breakfast table. As
usual Fanny was the first to rally. She had dreamed that
Jack came upon her unexpectedly at The Plateau and
found her in her chair by the window, not watching for
him, as she did not expect him, and had no thought he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>near until he came behind her and kissed her, saying
‘Fanny!’ in the old-time voice, which sent through her
such a thrill of ecstasy that she awoke and had not slept
since. This she told to Annie, her face glowing with excitement,
while Annie made no reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know what you think,” Fanny said. “You don’t
believe Jack will be quite so ready to respond as all that,
but something tells me he will.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her feeling of shame was wearing away, and in a few
days she was as gay as ever, and Annie often heard her
humming Bonny Doon, and once she tried Dixie, which
Jack had said she rattled off so fast. The weather now
was very hot and sultry, but the sultriest, hottest day
found her at The Plateau, which one would have thought
she owned from her interest in it. She would not acknowledge
that she believed in dreams, but the one in which
Jack figured so largely had made a strong impression upon
her, filling her with a presentiment that it would come
true, and at The Plateau, too. Every day she went there
and sat in the bay window of <em>our room</em>, sometimes reading,
sometimes half-dozing, and always with a thought of
Jack coming up behind her and saying softly, not ‘Mrs.
Errington,’ but ‘Fanny,’—a word which would mean all
heaven to her.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter XIV.—Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>FANNY OR MRS. ERRINGTON.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>It was in Boston that Jack received Fanny’s letter,
together with one from Annie, which had followed him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>from Montreal. He recognized Fanny’s handwriting and
wondered why she was writing to him. Annie’s letter
was of the most importance, and he read it two or three
times and kissed her name when he finished it and said
aloud “My Annie, my wife that is to be. I shall see you
very soon.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It did not occur to him that there was in it a little note
of pain scarcely perceptible to one who did not hold the
key, but still there, for Annie’s heart had been sore when
she wrote it. Easily affected by the atmosphere around
her she could not help being more or less moved by
Fanny’s oft repeated assertion that Jack would forgive
her everything and that they would meet on the old footing,
and when she looked at the brilliant woman lovelier
now than she had ever been, for to her beauty of face and
person was added a grace and elegance which she had
lacked in her girlhood, she said to herself, “How can he
be insensible to her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>And this affected her spirits when she wrote to Jack,
who was quite oblivious of it all.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now for Fanny’s letter,” he said, when Annie’s had
been put away, and breaking the seal he read it with many
and strange emotions, the most prominent of which was
surprise that it should have been written.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then, as he remembered how impulsive Fanny was,
acting usually on the spur of the moment and repenting
afterwards, he understood better, but was sorry, for her
words awoke no answering response in his heart. The
chords which had once thrilled to her slightest touch were
stilled forever, and nothing she could do would stir them
into life again. She had tried to be guarded, asking only
for his friendship as she had it when they were girl and
boy together, but he read between the lines and saw the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>love offered to him and the feeling of assurance that it
would be accepted. Some men would have rejoiced to
return in part the pain they had been made to suffer, but
Jack never harbored malice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor Fan, I am sorry for you,” he said, “but it is
too late; my love for you can no more be resurrected
than The Boy you wept over years ago. I am your friend
always, but never your lover again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he began to wonder how he should meet her, and
to wish she were not at The Elms, and why Annie had not
told her, as she ought to have done. Fanny’s offer of
money he resented, although knowing it was well meant.
“Money, always <em>money</em>, as if that were all,—but, thank
God, I do not need it, and if I did, I’d starve before I’d
touch a dollar which came this way,” he thought, and
without reading the letter a second time he tore it in pieces
which he burned in the gas and then blew the ashes away
with his breath.</p>

<p class='c014'>Poor Fanny, singing snatches of Bonny Doon,—putting
aside all regret for what she had done, and making herself
believe that in a general way her dream would come true.
She had had it three times,—not always the same in detail,
but the same in substance, and it must come true. It did
not occur to her that this was the natural result of dwelling
upon it so constantly and having it in her mind before
falling asleep. It was a sign for good and she grew
brighter every day, and every day went to The Plateau
near train time and sat in the willow chair and watched
and waited for Jack, with a feeling that he would certainly
come.</p>

<p class='c014'>And he did come, but not by train. He had business
in Petersburg, and after it was transacted drove to Lovering.
The road led past The Plateau, and as he had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>seen the place for some time he dismissed the carriage
which had brought him from Petersburg and walked up
the hill to The Plateau. The rear door stood open, and
with no thought that Fanny was there, but a hope that he
might find Annie, he went in. There was no one below
stairs, but on a table in the parlor lay a white scarf
which he recognized as Annie’s. She was there, of course,
and he went up the stairs whistling as he went and calling
softly, “Annie, my darling, where are you? Don’t you
hear me coming?”</p>

<p class='c014'>No one answered, for Fanny was asleep. She had sat
in the bay window two hours or more reading and thinking,
until, overcome by the heat and lulled by the drone
of insects outside and the gentle soughing of the wind
through the two tall pines which stood in the grounds, her
book had dropped into her lap, one hand had fallen at her
side, and her head lay back upon her chair, with her face
turned a little to one side. Had she posed for a month
she could not have selected a more graceful attitude in
which to be found by a lover than this in which Jack
found her. He saw her as he crossed the threshold, and
still thinking it to be Annie went very cautiously towards
her, starting as he came close to her and drawing a long
breath. That head was not Annie’s. Her hair was brown;—this
was much darker. Neither was that hand Annie’s.
Hers was smaller and not quite so white as this one,
which he had kissed so many times and for which he had
bought a wedding ring, now put away forever. There was
another on the hand,—a broad band of gold, guarded by
a costly solitaire, which, as a ray of sunlight struck it,
blinked up at him with glints of color as if it had been a
human eye asking what he did there.  He knew this was
Fanny, and he came very near speaking her name. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>remembering the construction she would put upon it he restrained
himself, and stepping in front of her stood for a
moment looking at her as she slept, and noticing what
changes had been wrought in her since he last saw her on
the platform of the car, waving good-bye to him. She was,
if possible, more beautiful now than then,—with a kind of
patrician beauty he felt but could not define. Her figure
had lost some of its girlish symmetry, but had gained in a
greater fullness of outline, partly the result of nature and
partly owing to the skill of French dress-making. He had
never seen her asleep before, and had not realized how long
and heavy were the dark lashes resting on her cheeks. He
saw them now, and saw, too, the incipient lines around her
mouth and eyes and the few threads of silver in her hair,
and was conscious of a sensation such as we feel when we
see a lovely rose begin to loose its freshness.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a full minute he stood looking at her with no stir in
his heart, or longing for possession. And he was glad it
was so. If there had been a regret for the past, or a desire
for the future, he would have felt himself disloyal to
Annie. But there was none. She was only a beautiful
woman, of whose unconsciousness he was taking an undue
advantage. It was time to waken her, and he involuntarily
gave a whistle with which he used to notify her of
his presence on the piazza when he was a boy and she a girl
like the picture in the medallion. The sound awoke her
instantly and fully, and starting up she looked at him with
eyes in which her whole soul was showing, but in which
there was no surprise. Her dream had come true. Jack
was there! <em>Her</em> Jack, with the same handsome face and
honest eyes she remembered so well and with something
more,—something which contact with the world had
brought to him. She had called him countrified many a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>time, and made fun of his coats and pants and shabby hats,
but Col. Errington’s clothes had never fitted better nor
been worn with more grace than Jack’s were now. There
was, however, nothing of the dude about him. He was
simply a well-dressed man after the fashion of the city
rather than the country. And Fanny saw it at a glance
and was glad.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jack!” she said, stretching her hands to him and forgetting
for an instant what was to have been the password
between them, if he had received her letter.</p>

<p class='c014'><em>He</em> had not forgotten, and taking her hands and smiling
upon her, as he would have smiled upon any friend not
seen for a long time, he said in his old teasing way,
“Well, Sleeping Beauty, the beast took you unawares. I
hope I did not frighten you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was perfectly self-possessed, with something about
him, aside from his clothes, which Fanny had never seen
before. As a girl she had asserted her superiority over
him, as she did over everyone, and in his blind love he had
submitted to her will and confessed himself an ignoramus
whom she was to teach. Now he was a man to be respected
and feared, rather than dictated to and taught.</p>

<p class='c014'>Old Phyllis had been wont to say, when she saw Jack’s
perfect obedience to Fan’s slightest whim, “I clar for’t,
Miss Fanny done tote Mas’r Jack roun’ by de nose shameful.”
That time was past. He had opinions of his own,
and after they had talked together a few minutes Fanny
realized the change and began to feel that Jack might be
the ruling spirit now. He had called her neither Fanny,
nor Mrs. Errington. Evidently he had not received her
letter, and she was glad, for with this changed Jack beside
her she began to feel all her shame and regret for having
sent it returning to her. This Jack would hardly receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>it as the old Jack would have done. He might think her
unwomanly and immodest, and her hands worked nervously
together as she talked on indifferent subjects, scarcely
looking at him, or, if she did, blushing painfully and letting
her eyes fall at once. She never dreamed it would be so
hard to talk with Jack as she found it. She had thought that
all she had to do was to see him,—to smile upon him in
the witching way she knew so well, and then their former
relations would be at once re-established. Now he was
there with her, in the house which was to have been hers,—in
the room where she was to wait and watch for him,
and she was more ill at ease and constrained than she had
ever been in her life.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is the letter which makes me so cowardly, and
which he must never read,” she thought, and after a
moment she said with a gasp, “Ja-ack.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” he answered, as she did not go on at once.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ja-ack,—I sent you a letter ten days ago. I hope
you did not receive it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No?” Jack said, more as an interrogative than an assertion.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Fanny understood the latter, and went on more
cheerfully; “I am so glad. Promise me that if you do receive
it, as you may some time, you will bring it to me
unopened and unread.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was looking at him entreatingly, waiting for his
reply, which came quickly:</p>

<p class='c014'>“If your letter ever comes to me I will surely bring it
to you unread.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Unconsciously he had laid a little emphasis on the
<em>if</em>,—or there was something in his face or voice which told
Fan the truth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jack,” she began again, and this time in a tremor of
distress, “<em>did</em> you get my letter?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>With her eyes confronting him as they were Jack had
no choice left him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Jack, what must you think of me?” Fanny cried,
covering her face with her hands, while the tears trickled
through her fingers and fell upon her black dress. “I
don’t know why I did it,” she went on rapidly, “only I
longed to let you know how I hated myself for the wrong
I did you, and for which I have paid more dearly than you
know. I could not help writing the letter after I began
to think about it, and I hurried to get it off, and when
Annie expressed her disapprobation I was angry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did Annie know you wrote it?” Jack asked in
some surprise, and Fanny replied, “Not until it was
posted. Something she said opened my eyes to what I had
done. It was like waking from a dream, and I went to
the office to withdraw it, but it was gone. After awhile
I was glad I had sent it, or at least not sorry, and I made
myself believe that you would call me Fanny when we met
in token of perfect forgiveness and was happy in the
thought. I wrote it here in this room,—in this window,
where I was to wait and watch for you. You see I know
it all. I made Annie tell me everything, and if my heart
had not been dried and seared it would have broken
for you,—<em>Jack, for you</em>.” There was a sound in her voice
as she said “For you, Jack; for you,” which would
have stirred Jack mightily and made him take her in
his arms, if the past and Annie had not stood between
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I came up here into this room,” she continued, “and
on my knees expiated my sin, if anguish and tears can do it.
I had not cried in so long that I thought I should never cry
again. That was before George died. I never loved him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>he knew I never did, but I was faithful to him, and he said
I was kind. He left me all his money,—so much more
than I can manage or know what to do with and I wanted
you to have some of it,—wanted you to forgive me and
take it from me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In her excitement she had laid her heart more bare than
she had done in her letter. Jack had understood that;—he
understood her now and pitied her for the pain he
must inflict. At the mention of money his face clouded
and his voice was harder than it would otherwise have
been, as he said, “How much you mistake me, if you
think I could take your money,—<em>his</em> money. You mean
it kindly, I know, and so far I thank you. I am not as
poor now as I was when you shrank from sharing my
poverty, and if I were, you must see that I should accept
nothing from you. I do forgive you, Fanny. It is impossible
that I should feel otherwise than kindly to one
who was so much to me once that the whole world was
full of her, and I had no thought of anything which was
not connected with her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny was not crying now, but listening with her head
upon the table where his arm was resting while he toyed
with a fancy paper-knife, the last article he had bought
for her. He had found it in Richmond and brought it to
the room the morning of the day her letter came. He was
thinking of this and of everything connected with that
time. Perhaps this was why he spoke so plainly. He did
not mean to wound her unnecessarily, but he did mean to
remove from her mind all hope that things could ever be
again between them as they had been.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have no idea,” he said, “of my happiness that
day when I brought Annie here. It was as if all Heaven
had come down to make its abode in this room where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>blow fell, and I felt as if my blood were leaving me
drop by drop until I was one great block of ice. Heavens,
how cold I was, and I never was warm again until the
Florida sun shone on me as I sat on the sand at noon, with
my head uncovered, hoping the iceberg would thaw.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny was now sitting bolt upright, her eyes growing
larger and blacker until, as Jack went on, she felt her
blood oozing away drop by drop and leaving her the iceberg
Jack was describing. She was warm enough later
on, as Jack continued: “I have never felt unkindly towards
you, Fanny, and had you come into this room that
night and asked me to forgive you and spoken to me and
looked at me as you have looked and spoken now, I have
no doubt I should have taken you back, I loved you so
much. Even now you stand to me in a different relation
from any woman in the world, for you embody the memory
of something in my early manhood which was very sweet.
I would go through fire and water to serve you, but the
past is dead. You have been the wife of another man,
and I shall soon be the husband of another woman.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny’s face was spotted, but it turned as white as the
bit of muslin she wore at her throat when Jack added,
“Annie is to be my wife.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Annie! And she never told me!” Fanny gasped.
“I’ll never forgive her, never!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Jack knew she would, for it was not her nature to harbor
malice against anyone, and especially against Annie,
who was a part of herself. But the blow had struck her
hard. She was so sure of winning Jack that she had never
thought of a possible rival, and that rival Annie. Now,
however, she began to read backward and to see what in
her blindness she had not seen before. For a few minutes
resentment against Annie was uppermost in her mind.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>“She should have told me; it would have saved me all this
shame,” she said. And mentally Jack agreed with her,
although he would not say so, lest he should seem to be
blaming Annie. But he was sorry for Fanny. All her
hopes were dead. Jack was gone from her past recall,
and the world looked very desolate stretching on into the
future year after year, while she walked in it alone. Then
with a great effort she controlled herself and, smiling at
Jack through her tears, she said, “Never was there a
woman more abased and crushed than I am, but I shall
not die. I am too plucky for that. If you wanted revenge
you have had it. I think we are quits, and now I
am going home to have it out with Annie, and that will end
it. Don’t come with me. Wait till evening when the
storm will be over. My tantrums never lasted long, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The next moment she was gone, and Jack saw her taking
the path through the woods to The Elms. “Annie
is somewhat to blame, but I hope Fan won’t scratch her
eyes out,” he thought, as he started for the village in
another direction. There was no danger of that although
Fanny was very indignant, and rushing into the house like
a cyclone she plunged at once into the fray. It was
nearly supper time, and Annie was in her room making
some changes in her toilet when Fanny came in banging
the door behind her and standing with her back to it as
she told in part what had transpired at The Plateau.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Were you engaged when I came home at Thanksgiving?”
she asked, and Annie answered “No.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Were you engaged when you came to Washington?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then, why didn’t you tell me, and not let me prate
about Jack as I did, showing how much I cared for him?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>“Just because you did show me how much you
cared for him,” Annie replied, roused at last to defend
herself. “I tried to tell you two or three times in Washington,
but could not. It did not seem just the thing to
parade my happiness before you then, and tell you I had
won the lover you jilted and whom I was sure you hoped
to win back.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Annie was speaking very plainly, and without looking
at Fan went on: “There was another reason,—a stronger
one. I knew how Jack had loved you, and jealousy, perhaps,
or some other ignoble feeling, whispered to me that
now you were free, he might turn to you again, and this
has been the mainspring of my silence, which I regret exceedingly.
I might have written it to you, and did begin
one or two letters, but tore them up, saying to myself,
“I’ll give Jack a chance to see her, and if after that he
wavers ever so little towards me I shall know it and give
him up.” I could not share a divided love. I must have
all of Jack, or none. When you came home you were full
of him and so sure of him that I could not tell you. If I
had known you were going to write to him as you did, I
should have mustered courage and stopped it. I did not
know until it was too late, and, like a coward, I waited to
let Jack decide for himself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Which he has with a vengeance,” Fanny interposed.
“You ought to have heard him talk to me till I could
have crept on my knees out of his sight, I felt so small
and ashamed. It was kind, perhaps, to take such heroic
measures to cure me, but not like the old Jack whom I
could twist around my little finger. He isn’t that Jack
at all. I couldn’t twist him now. I should be afraid of
him. I was afraid of him, as I sat listening to him, but
never respected him so much in my life. I have had one man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>of whom I stood in fear. I don’t want another. You are
welcome to him. He would have come home with me,
but I told him to wait till I’d had it out with you. I’ve had
it out. It’s the only mean thing I ever knew you do,
but I forgive you and hope you will be happy. Of course
you will, but Jack will be the master. I shouldn’t like
that. You will. If I were you I would take off that
brown thing which is so unbecoming. Put on a white
gown this hot night. You are lovely in white. Jack is
coming, and you want to look your best.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fan’s anger and resentment were wearing off. She had
played her game and lost it, and as she had once said in
an emergency, there was no use crying for spilled milk,
she wouldn’t cry now. Jack was still Jack, and Annie
was Annie, and she could not afford to quarrel with them.
They were engaged, and she would do what she could to
further their happiness, and would begin by improving
Annie’s personal appearance. The brown gown annoyed
her, and she made Annie put on a white one and fixed her
hair more as she wore her own and fastened a rose at her
neck and kissed her, saying as she held her off for inspection,
“All you need is a little style to make you a beauty,
but just as you are any man might be proud of you and
glad that you were his. Jack is, I know. I believe I hear
him. He has come early. Go down and have the first
cooing over before I get there. Tell him the eagle has
not harmed his dove. Go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She pushed Annie from the room, and then falling
upon the bed, with her face down and her hands clinched,
she lay there a long time, fighting the hardest battle of
her life, while below stairs the cooing went on and Annie
was nestled in Jack’s arms, with her head upon his breast,
while he chided her for not having told Fanny and saved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>her from so much mortification. But he covered her
mouth with kisses while he chided, and she knew he was
not angry. “We must be married very soon now,” he
said energetically, as if afraid that Fanny might carry
him off bodily if he waited. He had nothing, however,
to fear from Fanny, who, having fought her fight and conquered,
was quite herself when she at last came down to
the supper which had waited so long that Phyllis’s turban
stood higher than Fanny had seen it before since she
came home. Fanny had made Annie as attractive as
possible, and then had twisted her own hair into a fashion
very unbecoming to her. She had not worn her widow’s
cap since she came to Lovering, but she brought out
one now, and perching it on the top of her head surveyed
herself in the mirror with a grim kind of satisfaction. She
could scarcely have told why she did this, unless it were
from some Quixotic idea not to overshadow Annie in
Jack’s eyes. She did not yet understand how wholly she
had lost his love and how absolutely Annie had won it.
Jack was not much given to noticing one’s dress unless
it were very pronounced. He had thought Annie uncommonly
pretty when he came suddenly upon her watering
a lily by the door, but he did not think of associating her
prettiness with her dress or the arrangement of her hair.
She was Annie,—his Annie,—whom he had not seen for
weeks, and he kept her at his side until Phyllis asked if
they was “never gwine to be done wid dat ar an’ come
to supper.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With the sound of Phyllis’s voice there came also the
soft trail of Fanny’s long dress on the stairs. There was
a good deal of dignity in her manner as she entered the
room and took her seat at the table, meeting with a smile
Annie’s look of surprise at the cap on her head and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>way in which she had twisted her hair back from her high
forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lord save us, what has de chile done to alter her like
dat ar,” came from under Phyllis’s breath, while even
Jack wondered what had changed her so, and finally-attributed
it to the cap, which seemed so out of place on her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny did most of the talking, and when supper was
over went to her room, leaving Jack and Annie alone, as
she knew they wished to be. She was not one to do anything
by the halves. She had given Jack up to her sister
and she meant to make the best of it, and as to her the
best seemed to be to remove herself from their way she
very soon found Lovering quite too hot for comfort, and
decided to go to the White Sulphur Springs with Marie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Maybe I shall come to see you married, and maybe I
shall not,” she said to Annie. “I can’t tell how I shall
feel. If I do come you may think I have a good deal of
inward and spiritual grace. I ought to have something
to sustain me, for between you and Jack I have been
pounded to a pummice. Even George would be satisfied,
if he knew. Poor George! he wasn’t the worst man in
the world.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was getting up quite a little sentiment for her husband’s
memory and talked of him a good deal, especially
to Jack, during the last days of her stay in Lovering, and
she persisted in wearing her cap and twisting her hair in
a fashion which Annie thought horrid. Once at the
Springs, however, there was a change. The cap disappeared,—the
hair came back to its usual becoming style;
there were narrow bands of white at the neck and wrists
of her black dresses, and among the guests there was no
one half so much admired and sought after as the beautiful
Mrs. George Errington of Washington.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Jack had decided that his marriage should take place
some time in October, and soon after Fanny left he made
arrangements whereby he could leave his business for a
while and join the party in Europe for the winter. Nothing
could please Annie better, and she immediately wrote
to Fanny asking if she would go with them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not if I know myself,” was her prompt reply, “and
you are crazy to ask it. A real honeymoon in Europe,
such as your’s and Jack’s will be, must be delightful, but
you ought to be alone. Think of me,—Jack’s first love,—stalking
along with you! No, thank you. And don’t
think I am eating my heart out with disappointment. I
am not. I felt stunned at first to find myself so completely
stranded, but there is a good deal left for me to enjoy
yet. It is something to be admired and complimented
and sought after as I am here, even if they are simpletons,
or fortune-hunters, who do it. The wedding is the
20th of October, is it? Well, I have decided to come and
do the honors, and I am going to bring you a diamond pin
and earrings, and make over to you Carl’s present to me
three years ago. He meant it for Jack’s wife, and Jack’s
wife shall have it. Give him my love, dear old boy.
Don’t be jealous. He is a dear old boy, and you are
sure to be happy with him. Going on the Celtic, are
you? We went on the Celtic, and our stateroom, where
Jack’s eyes haunted me so, was No —. Funny if you
should get it.”</p>

<hr class='c021'>

<p class='c014'>“Jack,” Annie said, the first time she saw him after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>the receipt of this letter, “have you engaged our stateroom
on the Celtic?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is the number?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No —.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Jack, can’t you change it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Change it! They told me it was one of the best
rooms on the ship. Why should I change it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know,” Annie said, holding Jack’s hand and
rubbing her head against his coat sleeve, “I don’t know,—only
that’s the room Fanny had when you haunted her
so with your eyes. Maybe the Colonel will haunt me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Humbug! If he does I’ll pitch him overboard.
Don’t go to being nervous, little woman,” Jack replied,
swinging her up in his arms as if she had been a child,
and kissing her till she struggled away from him.</p>

<p class='c014'>That day Jack received a letter saying that Mr. Emery
had sold the house on The Plateau to a lady,—a widow,—who
would probably take possession about the first of
October. As she might arrive unexpectedly, she would
be obliged if Mr. Fullerton would leave the key of the
house with the station master where she could get it at
once. “A lady and a widow,” Annie said, her interest
and curiosity piqued and increased by the fact that
neither the name nor whereabouts of the stranger was
given. Everything pertaining to The Plateau was as
much a mystery as ever, but busied with her preparations
for her wedding and journey abroad Annie forgot The
Plateau, until one morning when Jack came in and told
her that the lady of The Plateau had come on the early
train from Richmond. He had not seen her, but some of
the villagers had and described her as in deep mourning,
with a thick veil over her face, hiding her features from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>view. A stalwart negro, who seemed to be her factotum,
had gotten the key from the station master, and called a
carriage into which he put his lady and a white girl,
presumably her maid. Besides the big negro there were
three more servants in the party and they were now domiciled
at The Plateau. This was exciting, and the excitement
was further increased by the rumor circulated by
some black who had been to The Plateau to the effect
that the servants were all a stuck-up lot of city negroes,—that
the big one was a <em>butler</em>, and the white one spoke
some foreign gibberish and wore a cap.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who can the lady be?” Annie wondered, and when,
the next day, Jack proposed a drive past The Plateau she
assented readily, hoping she might get a glimpse of the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a warm afternoon, and as they drove slowly up
the hill they noticed that every window of the house was
open, while the servants seemed to be busy going in and
out. A box of flowers stood in the bay window of <em>our
room</em>, and near it a bird’s cage was hanging, showing that
the owner had appropriated the chamber to herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There she is,” Annie said, as the figure of a tall woman
passed before the window and was gone before Jack
had a view of her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who do you suppose she is?” Annie asked, and in
the next breath exclaimed, “Jack, what are you doing?
You certainly are not going to call!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I certainly am,” he replied, turning into the grounds,
while Annie continued to expostulate.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, Jack, it’s so soon. What will she think? I haven’t
any cards, and you do not even know her name.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We will learn it, then,” Jack said, springing from the
buggy and helping Annie to alight.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>They went to the front door, where Jack was going to
enter unannounced.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you crazy?” Annie said, giving a pull to the bell,
which echoed through the whole house and brought at
once the white maid who spoke the foreign tongue.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>Marie! Marie!</em> How came you here?” Annie gasped,
beginning to understand and looking enquiringly at Jack,
whose face told her that he knew whom they had come
to see.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell your mistress that Miss Hathern and Mr. Fullerton
are here,” he said, and with a bow the girl departed,
meeting her mistress on the stairs and saying something
to her in French.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next moment Fanny was in the room, half laughing
and half crying as she tried to explain.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I did not want the place sold to strangers, and bought
it myself, or had Mr. Emery do it for me. I have owned
it all the time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With Jack present she could not say that when she
bought it she had a hope that she might some day live
there a portion of the year with him. She had taken a
great fancy to the house the first time she saw it, and had
anticipated the day when as Jack’s wife she could give it
to him and say “We will still live here, and you shall see
me from the window waiting and watching as you come
over the hill.” That dream was ended, but she would
keep the place as the sepulchre of her hopes and Jack’s,
and when she was tired of Washington, as she was often
likely to be, she would come to The Plateau as to a kind
of Retreat, where she could rest and be near her old home.
Mr. Emery had bought the place in his own name and
then conveyed it to her, and she had furnished the means
with which to keep it up, and had put it in Annie’s care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>and Jack’s until she chose to appear as the real proprietor.
A good deal of this she told to Annie and Jack, the
latter of whom understood what she omitted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And here I am,” she added, with a smile which belied
a pain in her heart if there were any. “I’ve come for
the wedding and can be mistress of ceremonies, and have
brought Annie the loveliest gown, cream satin, and veil
and orange wreath. You will be married in church,” she
continued, as she saw Annie about to protest. “I know
you meant to have a quiet, poky thing at home, with gingerbread
and lemonade, but my sister shall have a wedding
that is a wedding, and one which will make the
people stare. You certainly ought to let me have my way
in this.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no use combatting Fan when she was as
much in earnest as she was now, and Annie did not try,
but yielded to her in everything.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next two weeks were busy and exciting ones in
Lovering, where the people gossiped and commented,
and messages were sent every day over the wires to
Richmond and Petersburg, and Fanny drove about the
town; to the caterer’s, the florist’s’ and The Elms,
where Annie’s dress was making by a modiste from
Richmond.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now you look like a bride. Full dress becomes you,”
Fanny said, when at last Annie stood ready for her bridal,
the creamy satin falling in soft folds around her slight figure,
which gathered height from the length of the train.</p>

<p class='c014'>The diamonds Fanny had brought lay in their case upon
the bureau, and on Annie’s neck were strings of exquisite
pearls which Fanny had fastened there, saying “They
are more like you than the diamonds, which will do for
other occasions.” Fanny was spending her money like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>water and Annie was not the only one who benefited by
it. Grand as she was in her bridal robes, Phyllis in her
way was grander still and far more conscious of herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny had not only bought her a wonderful turban of
crimson and orange, but also a black silk dress with a
short train. A negro in silk was something which Lovering
had not reached with all its strides towards freedom,
and some of the people disapproved and said so privately,
while the blacks were loud in their denunciations, saying
“Phyllis was nuffin but a nigger, if she did war silk.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Phyllis held her own and carried herself as if she owned
the house and the church and the rector and the whole
business, and walked like a duchess behind the bridal
party under the canopies which Fanny had ordered from
Richmond. The like had never been seen in Lovering,
and a crowd of whites and blacks gathered at the church
around the <em>tent</em>, as they called it, discussing the guests as
they arrived. Nothing could exceed the beauty of the
house and grounds that night. There was no moon, but
there were Chinese lanterns and lamps and torches everywhere,
making it almost as light as day outside, while inside
it was like a great garden of flowers, wagon loads of
which had been sent from Petersburg, together with a
brass band which at intervals played on the wide piazza,
around which hundreds of lookers on were assembled.
It was an affair not soon to be forgotten, and to this day
the stranger in Lovering is sometimes told by the blacks
of the grand doings when Miss Annie Hathern was married
to “Mas’r Fullerton, him as has been to congress twict
sense, and is the firstest man here;” of the band and the
<em>tents</em> and lanterns and fireworks and the <em>canterer</em> from
Richmond, and of old Phyllis’s silk gown in which she
felt so big. More blacks than Phyllis have worn silk in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>the reconstructed south, but she was the pioneer in Lovering
and fully realized the <i><span lang="fr">éclat</span></i> of her position, making a
most imposing figure as she moved among the staff of
trained servants which filled the kitchen that night and
with whom she had more than one fierce battle.</p>

<p class='c014'>What Fanny felt no one could guess. She seemed very
happy as she did the honors of the house, her black dress
in sharp contrast to the creamy satin of the bride who
looked so lovely and young as she stood by her husband’s
side and received the congratulations of her friends.
This was on Wednesday, and as they were to sail on Saturday
the bridal pair left The Elms the next morning
amid the cheers and good wishes of the crowd of people
assembled to see them off. Fanny was not with them.
She had said good-bye at the house and then been driven
to The Plateau, where, alone in her room, with her face
buried in her hands, she rocked to and fro, moaning to
herself, “Oh, Annie,—oh, Jack. It is very hard to bear.
I am glad you are happy; but how desolate your going
has left me and how dreary life is to me now.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PART IV.<br> <span class='large'>KATY AND CARL.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.—Annie’s Story.</span><br> <span class='c013'>IN THE OLD WORLD.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>When I first awoke at Langham’s in London and looked
from my window the fog was so thick that I could see
nothing but the gas jets flickering faintly in the gloom,
seeming not much larger than the smallest taper. It was
what the English call beastly weather and a very <em>narsty</em>
day, for a cold, drizzling rain was falling and adding to the
general discomfort, but to me it was glorious sunshine,
and has been ever since the night Jack made me his wife.
What a grand wedding we had, and how the people must
have gossiped about the expenditure,—the canopies,—the
carpets,—the caterers,—the flowers,—the lanterns
and lights and music which made the place fairyland, in
the midst of which I walked like one in a dream, knowing
only that Jack was by my side,—that the people were calling
me by his name,—and that I was perfectly happy.
Occasionally I caught a glimpse in a mirror of a little
brown-haired woman, gorgeous in satin and pearls and
lace, with a fleecy veil sweeping the floor as she walked,
and was conscious of wondering who she was, and thinking
she was rather pretty, though not like Fan, the queen
of the evening.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>How wonderfully beautiful her face was, beaming everywhere
and always with that smile, the brightest I have
ever seen. Poor Fan! I pitied her the next morning
when she said good-bye to me. The roses were gone
from her cheeks, and her eyes were so sad as she kissed
me and said “God bless you, Annie, and bring you safely
back.” Then she turned to Jack and involuntarily put
up her lips. He kissed her and I was glad. There can
be no jealousy of her now. Jack is mine, and I say it
over and over to myself so many times. Mine,—my Jack,
who grows dearer to me every day. If there are storms
on the sea I do not know it from experience, for the ocean
was like a lake and our crossing like a dream. We had
the same stateroom where Fanny suffered so much, but
although Jack’s eyes were on me a good share of the time
when I was awake they did not trouble me, and I always
smiled back at them when I met their gaze.</p>

<p class='c014'>We did not go to Morley’s, but to the Langham instead,
although the former is the more central of the two. I
think the fact that Col. Errington stopped there decided
Jack against it. He never speaks of the man and very
seldom of Fanny, who has left The Plateau and gone back
to Washington. I think we saw everything in London,
even to the Queen and the Princess; and we went everywhere,—not
to dinners and receptions as Fanny did, for
we knew no one, but to every place of interest of which I
had ever heard. And it was such a delight to see things
with Jack, although I think I tired him out, as I used occasionally
to hear him groan and see him put his hand on
his back as if it ached when I suggested Mad. Tussaud’s,
or the theatre, in the evening after we had been out all
day. In the museum he was specially listless, saying life
was not long enough to see all there was there, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>used frequently to sit down and tell me he would rest
while I examined the coins and stones and things for
which he did not care a red. But at the Tower and the
Abbey and St. Paul’s he was wide-awake, and knew so
much more about the old dead kings and queens and people
buried there that I felt myself quite an ignoramus beside
him.</p>

<p class='c014'>We staid in London two weeks, and with the exception
of the first few days the weather was as clear and fine as
it is at home in November. We had letters of congratulation
from Miss Errington and Katy, who were in Berlin,
and were to join us later in southern France or Italy.
Katy had sung twice at parlor concerts and had received
overtures for a public engagement at a high price if she
would take it. But she declined, actuated, as I afterwards
learned, by the remembrance of Carl’s last words
to her, implying that she must choose between his good
opinion and her Career. She had an aptitude for foreign
languages, and before going abroad had studied
French, Italian and German, and had applied herself so
assiduously to them since that she could render almost any
song in the language of the country, her English accent
only adding piquancy to her singing. Had she been sure
of Carl she might have gone upon the stage, knowing
that with her innate purity and sense of propriety she
could have maintained her integrity of character against
all odds and resisted temptation in every form. But
Carl’s “Then good-bye” was always present with her,
much as she tried to put it from her and to tell herself
that he was nothing to her, and she nothing to him, and
might, if she chose, be a law unto herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl had staid in Paris until Paul’s cure was assured,
if care were exercised for the next few years. Then he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>started suddenly for Switzerland, where, in Lucerne, he
met Katy, who, with Miss Errington, was at the same
hotel, the Schweitzerhof. She was undeniably glad to
see him, and her eyes told him so and brought back all
the love he had ever felt for her. There were walks under
the chestnuts which skirt the lovely lake,—trips up
the Rigi and Pilatus, with excursions into the country.
Katy’s loveliness had expanded and deepened like the
rose when the morning dew lies upon it. And Carl had
drank in her beauty and sweetness eagerly, like one thirsting
for something pure and good and a better life than
he had known, but as often as he opened his lips to say
the words he wanted to, she seemed to know it and either
managed to withdraw herself from him, or to talk of something
else until a third party joined them. She had
never forgotten the summer which meant so much to her
and so little to him, and had also heard rumors of the
French widow, which she resented, and held herself from
him in such a manner that love-making was impossible.
She had given up her Career for him, or thought she had,
and his record must be as spotless as her own and he as
single-hearted as herself, if she ever accepted him, and
when at last she left Lucerne his words of love were still
unspoken and she seemed as far from him as ever.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.—Author’s Story.</span><br> <span class='c013'>MADAME.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>By some chance the train which took Katy and Miss
Errington away brought Madame Felix, greatly surprised
and delighted to meet Monsieur Haverleigh and <i><span lang="fr">le petit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>garçon</span></i>, who she had no idea were in Lucerne. All this
she said in very broken English for the benefit of Sam
Slayton, who confided to Paul that Madame was an infernal
liar and more dangerous than ever. Possibly Carl
thought so too. It was such a change from Katy to this
woman who, by her delicate flattery and tacit appeal for
sympathy, had fascinated and controlled him against his
better judgment. He had left Paris without letting her
know where he was going, and had breathed freer when
the Jura mountains divided him from her. When with
her she absorbed him entirely and held him with cords
he could neither understand nor loosen. Away from
her, he could rebel against her influence and the ownership
of him which her manner implied. He was her <em>good
American friend</em>,—her <em>adviser</em>,—her <em>brother</em>, since she lost
her dear Felix, whose name she never mentioned without
her handkerchief going to her eyes in token of her
sorrow.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the Grand Hotel where she had spent much of her
time since her husband’s death she had been sitting one
evening with Carl in the court near some English people,
a part of whose conversation they overheard as it related
to themselves. “She has him sure,—more’s the pity;—her
husband hasn’t been dead so very long;—he don’t
look quite the chap to be roped in by a widow older than
himself,” were the disjointed sentences Carl caught, and
which Madame with all her ignorance of English understood.
Carl flushed angrily and was about to move away
when, with a shrug of her shoulders, Madame laid her hand
on his arm and detained him, saying, “Stay where you
are. I will go, if either; it is I they aim at, these nasty
English. I hate them;—not to understand that we are
friends, nothing more. Absurd to think different, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>I so much older than you;—many years,—two, three, four
perhaps. I am twenty-seven, and you? You are quite a
boy compared to me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl did not reply. He knew she would never see
thirty again, and he did not fancy being called a boy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will go to Passy and bury myself, if it annoys you
to be friends with me. Shall I?” she continued.</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl told her he didn’t care a <i><span lang="fr">sou</span></i> for the English or
what they thought, and she was not to go to Passy on his
account. She did go, however, the next day,—called there
suddenly on business which took her to Marseilles. Left
to himself Carl began to think, and as a result of the thinking
he packed his trunks and left Paris without leaving
his address at the hotel, an act for which Sam gave special
thanksgiving and dropped a piece of money on the plate
at St. Eustace’s, where he was in the habit of going to
hear the music. If Carl hoped to be rid of Madame in
this way he was mistaken, for she found his address at his
banker’s and started at once for Lucerne.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe she is the devil,” he said to himself when
he saw her alight from the railway carriage, affecting a
pretty air of invalidism as she came towards him.</p>

<p class='c014'>She had been ill in Marseilles, she said, and her physician
had ordered her to Switzerland for a change of air,
“and here you are, at the Schweitzerhof, I suppose. All
the swells go there. I was once there a month with dear
Felix, but now,—” she hesitated a moment and then went
on: “I did not write you the nature of the business which
took me so suddenly to Passy and Marseilles. I knew
your good heart would be so sorry for me. Felix was
not as rich as I supposed. He has a brother to whom he
owed a great deal of money and who had a mortgage on
the chateau. He is there now, and I,—I am poor. I
must go to the Cygne, where it is cheaper.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>She said all this very rapidly, with a tear or two on her
eyelashes, which might have dropped on her nose, if she
had ever done so unbecoming and vulgar a thing as to let
a tear stand upon that organ. She had the rare faculty
to cry just when she wanted to, and also to keep her tears
where they would do the most effective work. Naturally
she did not go to the Cygne, but to the Schweitzerhof,
and took a parlor and bedroom and seemed anything but
poor. She was, however, very quiet, and mixed but little
with any of the guests, except Carl. Over him she speedily
resumed her influence to some extent. She was so
bright and original and said such amusing things, and
always made him feel at his best with her delicate flattery,
which seemed so sincere that he could not resist her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Katy stands on so high a plane of puritanism that I
can’t touch her with a ten-foot pole. I always feel like a
cad with her, while with Julie I am satisfied and believe
myself a pretty good fellow,” he thought, and drifted
again into an atmosphere he knew was unhealthy and one
which he would not like Katy to breathe.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of himself he would not have told Julie that Katy had
been there; but Madame heard of her from Paul, who
was full of Katy, so beautiful, he said, and Carl loved her
so much and sat with her under the chestnuts and rowed
on the lake, and everything. Others than Paul talked of
the lovely American who had sung for them one night in
the parlor as no one had ever sung in Lucerne before.
Every guest in the house had come in to hear her, while
a crowd had gathered outside to listen. Madame smiled
sweetly as she heard all this, but there was fierce jealousy
in her heart of this young girl who had come between her
and Carl. He might never marry her, she knew, but she
would bind him to her with one of those Platonic friendships
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>which French women delight in, and which would
remove Katy from her path almost as effectually as marriage
would have done.</p>

<p class='c014'>“American women are so prudish,” she thought,
“and cannot understand that a man and woman can be
everything to each other and still be perfectly correct.
Once let Katy believe there is something between us not
quite <i><span lang="fr">au fait</span></i>, and I have nothing to fear from her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Still Katy troubled her, and she felt an irresistible desire
to talk of her to Carl, but always on the assumption
that she was his sister and nothing more.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They tell me your sister is very beautiful and sings
divinely. I wish I might have seen her. You must be
proud of her,” she said to him, and he answered, “She
is beautiful, and I am proud of her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Madame understood at once that he would rather not
discuss Katy with her, and her eyes shone for a moment
with a dangerous light, as she said next, “You must love
her very much?”</p>

<p class='c014'>To this Carl made no answer, and Madame continued:
“She was very young, I believe, when your mother went
to The Elms, was she not?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, very young,” Carl replied, wondering vaguely
how Madame knew so much about The Elms as she sometimes
seemed to know.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Paul has told her a great deal, I dare say,” he thought,
and then, at a sudden turn of Madame’s head and a lifting
of her eyelids there came to him a misty kind of feeling,
such as he had several times experienced, that somewhere
he had seen just such a poise of the head and heard
just such purring tones as belonged to Madame Felix.</p>

<p class='c014'>He had never spoken to her about it, but now, glad of
anything which would turn the conversation away from
Katy, he asked abruptly if she were ever in America.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>“In America!” she answered with great energy.
“<i><span lang="fr">Mon dieu! Jamais!</span></i> America, Monsieur?—nothing could
tempt me to cross the sea. I die upon the Channel.
Why do you think I have been in America?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because you remind me of some one I must have
seen,” he said, “and just now when you were talking of
Katy I could almost think who it was.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Impossible that you could have seen me. Impossible!”
and Madame shook her head very decidedly, but
said no more of Katy, either then or afterwards.</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl was going to Homburg from Lucerne, and when
he told Madame of his intention she declared it to be the
very place where she was expecting to go, hoping the
waters would do her good and where she knew of an inexpensive
<em>pension</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must retrench now,” she said. “Nearly every letter
I get brings worse news than the one before with
regard to my fortune, which I thought so large. I really
ought not to have staid at this hotel, and but for the accident
of meeting you should not.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl understood her, and with his usual generosity
offered to pay her bills, and when she declined with horror
from putting herself in so questionable a position, especially
as she had no Felix to protect her, he felt almost as
if he had insulted her and promptly asked her pardon,
offering as a loan what her self-respect would not allow
her to take as a gift. This she accepted, and a week
later found her in Homburg, whither Carl had preceded
her by a few days.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>
  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.—Author’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>AT HOMBURG.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Carl had expected Madame to go when he did, but with
a very pretty throwing up of her hands and a shrug of
her shoulders she had exclaimed “Mon dieu, Monsieur,
if all the world were as unsuspicious as you what a delight
to live. But there are more vile English than those we
met in Paris. Homburg is full of them, and I must be
discreet. Should we go together they might talk, and
I owe it to Felix’s memory to avoid the very appearance
of anything like an understanding. You will go first, and
I shall follow. There can be no harm in that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For the life of him Carl could see no harm in their
traveling on the same train, while going purposely at different
times looked as if there were something to conceal,
and, so far as he was concerned, there was nothing. But
he acquiesced and left her in Lucerne, promising to look
at the inexpensive <em>pension</em> she named, and to engage a room
for her if it were not too second-classy and he thought
she could endure it. She hated <em>pensions</em>. She had staid
in one or two after the Commune when the French aristocracy
fled for their lives. She detested them then, but must
get accustomed to them now in her changed circumstances,
she said, and remembering this Carl found the inexpensive
<em>pension</em> too second-classy to suit Madame, for
whom rooms were engaged at the —— Hotel, which
enjoyed the prestige of having the Princess Christian dine
in its garden every night, accompanied occasionally by
her brother the Prince of Wales. There was at first a
pretense on Madame’s part of protesting that she must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>not take the rooms. She could not afford it, but Carl
quieted her with another loan and the matter was finally
amicably adjusted.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was astonishing to Carl how many people Madame
knew at Homburg. Friends of other and happier days,
she said, as she presented them to him. Some of them
had titles, some seemed very well-bred, while others were
rather seedy, Carl thought. They all paid homage to
Madame, who soon had a little court around her and forgot
to weep for Felix as much as she had done. As an
American Carl felt himself the equal of anyone, and still
in his heart there was a kind of respect for rank and
aristocracy which made him overlook any little idiosyncracies
of manner and action in Madame’s friends. It
was this same feeling which had drawn him more closely
to Madame herself. He knew that Monsieur Felix’s family
was good, and without saying it in so many words Madame
had insinuated that hers was equally as good. If he had
ever doubted this he believed it in Homburg, where she
knew so many titled people, and he was not a little proud
to be one of her set. Sam suspected them of being sharpers,
especially after he found how much time they spent
with cards in Madame’s private parlor. Carl was usually
with them a looker-on at first. He had never played for
money in his life, and for a few days his New England
training and the memory of his mother restrained him.
Then Julie persuaded him to take a hand with her just
for once.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The stakes are not very high and I nearly always win,
and Count de Varré is ill to-night,” she said, and Carl sat
down and won and gave his winnings to Madame.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he tried his hand again and won till Madame had
quite a little sum at her command. Naturally social, Carl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>found Madame’s friends very agreeable and amusing, especially
the ladies, one of whom was young and unmarried,
while the other was a widow and a baroness and took snuff
and talked loud and wore big diamonds. They all made
much of Carl, whose fortune rumor, as usual, had doubled.
Every night they played, sometimes in one private salon,
sometimes in another,—and Carl frequently was one of the
party. When he played with Madame he usually won, not
very much,—but still won,—and when he played against
her, he lost,—sometimes heavy sums, which made him
shiver a little when next day he gave his cheque for the
amount, and all the time Sam Slayton watched them as
closely as if he had been a detective.</p>

<p class='c014'>One night they met in Carl’s salon, Madame playing
with Count de Varré and the old baroness with Carl, who
lost, but kept on playing until Sam, who had persisted in
staying in the room and at a little distance had been watching
the game closely, suddenly exclaimed, as he caught
Carl’s arm, and prevented him from putting down a certain
card, “Great Jerusalem, don’t you know they are
all in league and fleecing you? I learned a trick or two
in the army, but never thought to see it practiced among
decent people.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Madame, the only one who understood Sam, nearly
fainted, while the Count sprang to his feet, demanding
angrily the cause of the disturbance and why this boor of
a fellow was allowed with gentlemen, and what he had
said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He said you were cheating at cards, and by George I
believe he spoke the truth,” Carl answered, the mists suddenly
clearing from his moral perceptions and showing
him the danger he was in.</p>

<p class='c014'>The scene which followed was rather lively, the Count
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>denying the charge and hurling angry invectives against
Sam, who, not comprehending a word, met them with
Yankee coolness and indifference, but stood his ground
manfully and showed <em>how</em> the cheating was done, while
Madame protested that if there had been cheating she was
not a party to it, and begged Carl to believe her, and became
at last so violently hysterical that, whether he believed
her or not, he made a pretense of doing so.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was as plain as the nose on your face,” Sam said
in describing it to Carl. “I can’t say that Madame
cheated, but the others did and gave information across
the table in the most barefaced way. I told you they
was sharpers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl began to think so too. Possibly Madame was
innocent. He was inclined to think she was, but it
was a very questionable kind of people to whom she had
introduced him, and he resolved to break away from his
Homburg associates,—cleanse himself from their atmosphere,—and
then find Katy, confess everything to her,
and sue for the love for which he was beginning to long so
intensely. To leave Madame, however, was not so easy to
do. Since the episode in his room she had been very
despondent, and while affecting to be indignant at the
Count, had clung more and more to Carl, and always
spoke of going when and where he went as a matter of
course. In this respect an accident favored him. He
was not very fond of early rising, and seldom joined the
crowds which went to the Springs before breakfast. He
had been there once with Madame, who never missed a
morning, and once with Paul, who went to see the Prince
of Wales, and who, when he saw him, exclaimed “Why,
Carl, he’s only a man with a white dog and gray clothes
like Sam’s,”—a remark which greatly amused those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>heard and understood it. After that Carl staid in bed and
left Paul to go alone with Sam to see the Prince and his
white dog.</p>

<p class='c014'>One morning as he was waiting for them to return and
wondering why they were so late Sam came rushing into his
room, exclaiming, “Hurrah, now’s your time to cut and
run! Madame has broken her ankle and will not walk for
weeks. We had a great time getting her to the hotel.
Took me and the Count and two lords, and all hands. I
tell you, she’s solid!”</p>

<p class='c014'>It seemed that in going to the Springs for her eight
glasses of water, Madame had somehow slipped and broken
her ankle in two places and was brought to her room at
the hotel in great agony. It was impossible not to be
sorry for her and for a day or two Carl staid by her, seeing
that she had every attention and comfort. Then he
announced his intention to leave Homburg, which had become
so distasteful to him that he hated himself for being
there and was anxious to get away. Just where he was
going he did not know, but he had Copenhagen in mind,
with Stockholm afterwards, and possibly St. Petersburg
and Moscow and Warsaw, if it were not too late. Madame’s
ankle would keep her a prisoner for some time in
Homburg, and the trip he contemplated was far too expensive
for her to undertake. She could not follow him,
and he felt as if a great weight had been lifted from him
and left him a free man as the train took him away from
Homburg and the people whose influence had been so
pernicious. He would like to have joined Katy, but did
not think himself worthy yet to stand in her presence and
meet the glance of her innocent blue eye.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must be washed and boiled and ironed first,” he
thought, and after a few days’ stay at Frankfort, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>Sam affected to live in constant expectancy of seeing Madame
come hobbling in on crutches, they left for Copenhagen.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.—Annie’s Story.</span><br> <span class='c013'>AT MONTE CARLO.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>All this happened in the summer and early autumn before
Jack and I went to London and from thence to Paris,
where the brightness and beauty of the gay city astonished
and bewildered me. I did not know that anything
could be as beautiful as its boulevards, its parks, its late
flowers and fountains, and crowds of happy-looking people
seen everywhere. Its shop windows were a constant
delight, and Jack could scarcely get me away from them.
Had we staid in Paris long I should have developed a great
passion for dress. As it was I began to want everything I
saw, until I inquired the price, when my ardor cooled a
little. I was never tired of the picture galleries, or the
Bois de Boulogne, or the Champs d’Elysées, or the Avenue
de l’Opéra, on which our hotel looked, or of counting
the number of white or gray horses seen in a day, and
which sometimes amounted to a thousand.</p>

<p class='c014'>The weather was cold, but crisp and dry,—the trees
were leafless and the grass dead, but I did not mind it at
all, and would like to have staid in Paris all winter, but
for Jack, who wanted to move on.</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl, who had been to St. Petersburg and Moscow was
now in Berlin, while Katy and Miss Errington were in
Monte Carlo, and urged us to join them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We are not here for play,” Katy wrote, “although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>there is a great fascination in watching it and the people,
and when you see how easily money is sometimes won
you are tempted to try your luck. But I have not done
so, and shall not. I should be ashamed to look Paul in
the face (I knew she meant Carl), if I had played with the
men and women who nightly crowded the Casino. We
are not in a hotel, but in a lovely villa which Miss Errington
has rented. She is not strong,—is very tired with
travel, and the air here suits her, while the town suits me.
It is the loveliest spot in all the world, and like a garden
every where, while the sea is a constant delight. Do
come and join us. We have plenty of room and the weather
is soft and warm as October at home. Norah isn’t with
us, but is coming soon. She found some cousins in Germany
and wanted to <em>rest up</em> awhile with them. We miss
her more than I can tell. She is so efficient and faithful.
I doubt, though, if she gets along amicably with the servants
here, and her shoes will undoubtedly creak some at
their way of doing things. I am getting to be quite a
gossip, or at least very curious about my neighbors, and
so suspicious too. So many seem to be under a cloud.
If you see a beautiful woman driving in a beautiful carriage,
behind beautiful horses, with a young man beside
her, and ask who she is, the chances are that the person
you interrogate shrugs her shoulders and says, ‘She is
Lady <em>So-and-so</em>, separated from her husband, and the young
man beside her is Lord <em>Somebody</em>, who owns the fine turnout
and the villa she lives in and the diamonds she wears.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you feel disgusted and ashamed of your sex,
but go to the Casino just the same to watch the play, and
the haggish old women, with their black bags, in which
they keep their gold and silver, and the young women,
fair English and American girls, sitting side by side with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>blear-eyed roués whom they sometimes touch in their
feverish haste to gather up what they have gained, and
put down more. Then, in spite of yourself, you look
about till you find Lady <em>So-and-so</em>, painted and powdered,
with the young man who owns the horses and carriage and
diamonds and her, standing behind her while she stakes
<em>his</em> money as coolly as if it were her own. By and by a
friend, who knows everybody, calls your attention to a
gray-haired man in the crowd and tells you it is Earl <em>So-and-so</em>,
husband of the painted woman playing so recklessly.
While you are hurrying to look at him you stumble
upon another celebrity, who tried to kill himself and
failed, and is now at the table again, with the perspiration
rolling down his face and despair showing in his eyes.
To-morrow he may finish the work he began a week ago,
and there will be a fresh grave in that enclosure of suicides
on the hillside.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Errington laughs at me, I get so excited, and
interested in it all, particularly in our next-door neighbors,
who occupy the grand villa which stands so close to ours
that I can see all they do, and often hear what they say.
It is a very gay party, of French and Germans; several
gentlemen and three ladies, one of whom interests me
greatly and seems to be the central figure. She is all in
black, except when she wears a rose or some other flower
to relieve her sombre dress. Her eyes are black, her eyebrows
heavy, her color brilliant and her hair golden and
wavy. She is slightly lame, and in the morning sits a good
deal on the verandah on our side just where from my window
I can see her distinctly, or could until she caught me
looking at her through a glass. Impertinent in me, I
know, but she fascinates me somehow with her complexion
and hair and eyes. Maybe she didn’t see me, but she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>spoke to our cook that day and asked her who we were
and since that she has sat further away with her back to
me and her long hair rippling down to her waist as if she
were drying it. She goes to the Casino every night, and
once when I stood watching her she stopped suddenly and
left her seat. People tell me that old habitues are superstitious
and will not play if strangers are looking at them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You must come soon and help me attend to my neighbors’
business. Miss Errington is no good at all, and
only laughs at my excitement, but she, too, says, tell you
to hurry. We need a man with us to keep us from being
talked about, as two lone women whom nobody knows.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After the receipt of this letter I was crazy to reach Monte
Carlo and see Lady <em>So-and-so</em>, who was separated from her
husband, and the Earl from whom she was separated, and
the haggish old women with black bags, and the man who
had tried to kill himself, and all the other questionable
people of the place. Jack made no objection to leaving
Paris, and in three days we were at Monte Carlo, said to
be the loveliest and wickedest place in the world. I saw
only the loveliness at first; and from the moment I began
to climb the steep steps from the station to the terrace above
I was one exclamation point of delight, and when I reached
Miss Errington’s villa, which looked out upon the sea
and the Casino and Park in front, I was speechless with
wonder that anything could be so fair as the scene around
me. Miss Errington’s villa was small, but exceedingly
pretty, and stood on the same grounds with what we called
The Grand Villa, while ours was <i><span lang="fr">La Petite</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was late in the afternoon when we arrived, and I had
just time to freshen myself a little before dinner was served.
Katy had given us her room, which was larger than
the guest chamber, and while making my toilet I was constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>glancing from the windows toward the Grand Villa,
the piazza of which seemed to be full of people in evening
dress, and the sound of their voices was distinctly heard.
Conspicuous among their light costumes was a soft, black,
fleecy dress, the train of which reached far behind the
lady who wore it, and whose face I could not see, as her
back was towards me. I could, however, distinguish
masses of golden hair piled high on the top of her head,
with one or two curls falling gracefully in her neck.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is Katy’s Madame,” I said, as I tried to get a
glimpse of her face, while Jack chaffed me for my curiosity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Evidently it was a large dinner party assembled at the
villa, and we saw them filing into the salon and seating
themselves at the long table loaded with silver and cut
glass and flowers. Then the shades were dropped, and
hid them from our sight, but we could hear their merry
laughter, louder it seemed to me and coarser than that
of real gentlemen and ladies.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not believe they are real,” Katy said. “They
are shams,—even if they have titles among them. Their
<em>chef</em> told ours that Count de Varré rents the villa and they
picnic together. The woman in black is Madame Felix.
Paul has written me something about her. What do you
know of her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I replied by repeating at length all I had heard of her.
“I should not be greatly surprised if Carl joined the party
later. He was at Homburg with some of them,” I said,
and repented my words the next moment, Katy turned so
pale and looked so distressed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Carl consorting with such people and Paul with him;
and you knew it and did not stop it!” she exclaimed, and
in her eyes, blue as they were, there was a look like Fan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>when her blood was at fever heat and her eyes at their
blackest with red spots in them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What could I do?” I asked. “Paul is beyond my
control when with Carl, and I do not believe he has been
harmed. She has evidently been very kind to him and he
likes her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I remember. I understand perfectly why she is
kind to Paul,” Katy replied, and I could hear her foot tap
impatiently under the table, as she grew more and more
like Fan. “If Carl comes to that villa with Paul, I’ll
never speak to him again,” she added.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was greatly excited and her excitement continued
until dinner was over and we were on our way to the Casino.
The party from the Grand Villa were just ahead of
us,—Madame, with her black train thrown over her arm,
showing clouds of white lace and muslin underwear, while
the man who, Katy said, was Count de Varré, walked
beside her, occasionally putting his hand on her shoulder
when she limped more than usual. We purposely held
back that they might enter before us; “and get well under
way before Madame spies me,” Katy said, a trifle
viciously for her. “The last time I was here I went in
when she did, and you should have seen the great black
eyes she leveled at me for an instant, and then with a half
shrug walked away. She didn’t play that night while I
was there. I believe she thinks I am her evil genius.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We were in the Casino by this time and I wanted to look
about me a little, but Katy hurried us on to the play-rooms,
ablaze with light and splendor and people gathered from
all parts of the globe,—French, Germans, Russians, Italians,
English and Americans,—young and old, beauties
and belles, wrinkled hags and fair, innocent looking girls,
who had staked their first five francs stealthily, as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>ashamed to do it,—their second, if they won, with more
assurance,—their third, with still more, until at last every
afternoon and evening, Sunday not excepted, found them
there, sitting between and jostled by men to whom at
home they would consider it a degradation to speak, or be
near. At one table sat an old, shrivelled woman, playing
heavily, but so blind and deaf and demented that she did
not always know whether she had lost or won, until her
maid, who stood behind her, told her, and raked the gold
into her bag. At another table was a young man; an
American, just married, and also playing heavily, but losing
as heavily, while his girl-wife beside him looked on with
tearful eyes and an occasional remonstrance as she saw
what was perhaps their all melting away so fast. It was
wonderful, and bewildering, and intoxicating, and as I went
from table to table and heard above the hum of voices
the constant sing-song of the croupiers “<i><span lang="fr">Faite le jeu; le
jeu est fait</span></i>,” and looked at the players and saw how rapidly
the gold and silver changed hands, I could understand
how strong was the temptation to try one’s luck when
only five francs was the stake and there was no possible
chance for cheating or being cheated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Would you like to risk a dollar?” Jack said, to try
the strength of my principles.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, indeed,” I replied, just as Katy pulled my sleeve
and whispered, “There they are,—the party from the
Grand Villa,—all at the same table. Madame has her
back to us. You and Jack go round where you can see
her without letting her know you are watching her. By
and by I’ll come and hypnotize her so she’ll quit playing.
You’ll see!”</p>

<p class='c014'>We left Katy and went round to the other side of the
table, getting as near to it as possible and, without seeming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>to watch Madame, scanned her curiously. She was handsome,
with that voluptuous kind of beauty so many men
admire. She was quite tall and stout, but her figure was
so perfect that one forgot her size entirely. I knew that
she owed much of her brilliant color to art, but it was art
perfected, as was the shading under her eyes which two or
three times swept the crowd in front of her as if in quest
of someone. I might have been mistaken, but I thought
there was a look of relief in them as if the one they feared
to see was not there. Once she smiled and spoke to the
man beside her, Count de Varré, showing a dimple in one
cheek and a set of very white even teeth. Her chief
attraction, however, was in her golden hair which contrasted
so strongly with her eyes and eyebrows. It was
certainly a strange freak of nature,—that hair and those
eyes,—and I said so to Jack, and asked him what he
thought of her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is striking, certainly,” he said, “and just the
kind of woman to please some men,—Carl, for example;
but she is not my style, and by George, I believe I’ve seen
her before.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is hardly possible,” I replied, “inasmuch as she
is a born French woman.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you know she is a born French woman,” he
asked, and I rejoined, “I don’t know for sure, but have
taken it for granted. When Paul first met her she could
not speak English. Don’t you remember he wrote that
he was teaching her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“English or no English, I have seen that woman before,
or some one like her,” Jack said.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was good at remembering faces, while I was not
good at all, and still I, too, was beginning to think that I
had seen Madame, when Katy came up and said, “Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>let me have your place, while you step aside, and see how
soon I can make her uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stepped aside, standing a little to the right of Katy,
whose face I could not see. But I saw Madame who, after
a little, began to fidget in her chair and cast frequent
glances across the table to where Katy stood, not looking
at her all the time, but making it sufficiently manifest that
she was watching her. Strangely, too, Madame began to
lose. This made her more nervous than ever, and at last,
folding her hands in a despairing kind of way, she said
something to the man beside her. Following the direction
of her eyes he saw Katy and at once came round to
her. Bowing low he begged a thousand pardons, but did
she speak French or English?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Both,” she said, and he continued, rubbing his hands
and bowing all the time, “So sorry, but Madame Felix,
the lady in black, is not well,—is nervous,—and it affects
her much to have Mademoiselle look at her with those
eyes, which,—pardon,—if I were not a stranger I should
compliment.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Something in the eyes warned him not to compliment
them, and he went on: “She loses courage; she loses
money. In short, will Mademoiselle be so very good to
go to some other table and watch somebody else. Am
very sorry to ask it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly I will,” Katy said, turning her back upon
Madame, who recovered her composure and began to play
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Jack and I were watching her now almost as intently as
Katy had done and with a more startling effect. Evidently
she had not been aware of our presence before,
and now when she saw us she seemed for a moment spellbound
and stared at me as if I had been some unexpected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>apparition confronting her. Then she looked at Jack,
who, I have always insisted, bowed slightly. He says he
didn’t, but confesses to a half smile which so disconcerted
her that she turned pale and, leaning back in her chair,
whispered to the Count and left her seat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are worse than Katy,” Jack said, with what
sounded like a low whistle as he saw her going to another
table as far from us as possible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I told you I would rout her,” Katy said, as she joined
us, while Jack declared it was I who did it. “She actually
turned green when she saw Annie,” he said. “Who
the dickens can she be?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A miserable scheming woman,” Katy answered, and
I knew she was thinking of Carl and his connection with
Madame.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was getting tired of the play-rooms and we went outside
into the vestibule where we sat down so near the entrance
to the little opera that we could hear the music
distinctly. I did not care to go in that night, preferring
to sit where I was and see the people pass and repass.
After a moment Katy said, “There is something I want
to tell you and may as well do it here. I am going to sing
in public to-morrow night.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sing in Monte Carlo,—in the Casino!” I exclaimed,
and Katy replied, “In Monte Carlo, yes; but not in the
Casino. There is a grand salon at the —— Hotel capable
of seating two or three hundred, and they are willing
to give from two to five dollars to hear me sing, or rather,
to be more modest, to the cause for which I am to sing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what is that?” I asked in a tone which made Katy
look closely at me as she replied, “You have some of
Fan’s prejudice against the stage, I see. Well, this isn’t
the stage exactly, although there is to be a temporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>one, I believe. Haven’t you heard of that little town near
here which has been visited with pestilence and earthquakes
and lastly by a fire until it is half a ruin and the
people sleep in the fields? The concert is for their benefit,
gotten up and engineered by an English earl and his
lady. So, you see, it is in every way <i><span lang="fr">en règle</span></i>. All amateurs,
except the tenor and the contralto, whose voices
harmonize perfectly with mine. They are husband and
wife and highly respectable. The other performers are
English. I am the only American, and the drawing
card!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What do they know of you?” I asked, and she replied,
“I sang in Berlin and in Nice and once here. The
Earl heard me in Berlin and Nice, too, and insisted upon
my taking part here as prima donna. Now you have it
in a nutshell, except that the rush for tickets increased
and the prices went up when it was known that I was to
sing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t you dread it?” I asked, and with a merry laugh
she answered, “Dread it? No. I anticipate it. I know
I can sing. I sometimes feel as if I could fill the whole
world when I get my voice under control, and how I
should like to try the Grand Opera House in Paris. I
sang twice in Berlin in a concert hall to crowded houses.
Just before I was to go on my heart beat like a big drum,
but the moment I was on the stage and saw the people
and they saw me and began to cheer, I forgot everything
but my own voice to which I was listening, and which
carried me back to the robins I used to imitate in the
garden and woods at home, and it seemed to me that I
was a big robin making my throat move just as they used
to do when they sat in the jasmine and honeysuckle and
sang to me in the morning. I imitated them then; I can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>do it better now. You will see. You don’t know how
the people applauded and encored until I was tired of
coming out, and when the concert was over they nearly
broke through the floor, and so many came forward to
congratulate me,—the Earl and his lady with the rest.
The next day I was deluged with cards and calls and
flowers, and had I chosen I might have commenced a
career then and there, I had so many overtures for engagements
with real stage people. I am glad I am to sing
to-morrow night, and that you and Jack are to hear me.
Fan said she’d rather see me dead than on the stage.
Carl said so, too, but God gave me my voice. Why
shouldn’t I use it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You should, for all good objects, but don’t go in for
a Career,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are as bad as the rest of them; all are against
me,—even Jack,” Katy rejoined, glancing up at Jack,
who had listened but said nothing, except to ask if we
were not ready to go home.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Errington, who had not been with us at the Casino,
was waiting for us in the salon and there were lights at
the Grand Villa, showing that some of its occupants had
returned. It was Madame and the Count, Miss Errington
told us, adding that they had come back sometime ago,
and that, judging from the sound of Madame’s voice, she
was either excited or ill.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She’s seen the evil eye again,” Katy said, recounting
her experience with the lady, while Jack whistled just as
he had done at the Casino, and was promptly reproved by
me for his ill-manners in whistling before people.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t you remember that girl we used to have?” I
said, “what was her name,—<em>Julina Smith</em>. She used to
whistle until Mrs. Hathern heard her and nearly took her
head off.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>“What made you think of her?” Jack asked, and I replied,
“I don’t know. She happened to come into my
mind,” and there the conversation ceased.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>THE CONCERT.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>The next day I saw that great preparations were making
for the concert to be given in the grand salon, and
heard from Miss Errington that much interest was felt by
the Americans and English because Katy was to sing.
Several times the Earl came to our villa to consult with
her, and once the Italian tenor and contralto came and
practiced one or two pieces, and Katy went with the Earl
to the hotel to see just where she was to stand and where
enter. Taken altogether, there seemed to be quite a professional
air about it all which I didn’t quite like, and I
said so to Jack, who answered “Oh, let Katy sing, if she
wants to. It won’t hurt her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what will Fan and Carl say? I wish he were
here,” I continued, whereupon Jack was more provoking
than ever, and replied, “I don’t think Carl need say much
after his racket with Madame!” and then he whistled
again in what I thought a very exasperating way and told
him so, from which it will be seen that we were getting
quite like married people.</p>

<p class='c014'>For answer he laughed and said “<i><span lang="fr">Nous verrons</span></i>,” about
the only French he had picked up, and I heard him laughing
in his dressing-room where he was making his toilet
for the evening. We went early to the salon, but early
as we were the party from the Grand Villa were there before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>us, all except Madame, who was probably enjoying
herself at play, undisturbed by Katy, or myself. We
were not far from the front and could not see who entered
behind us, but we knew the salon was filling fast
and that some were standing near the door. Behind the
curtain of the improvised stage shadowy figures were flitting,
and we caught occasionally the sound of suppressed
voices evidently giving orders. Jack had gone to the
villa, after my fan which I had forgotten, and I had fought
one or two battles over his chair and was longing for him
to return and wondering why he was gone so long, when
he came tearing in. I can use no other expression than
<em>tear</em>, he was so excited and warm, as if he had been
running. “By George,” he said, handing me my fan
and sinking into his seat, “It’s the best joke I ever
knew.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s the best joke? Are you crazy, Jack?” I
asked, as he seemed about to roar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he pulled himself together and answered quite
soberly, “You wished Carl were here, and he <em>is</em> here,—in
this hotel,—or was; came on the evening train. I glanced
at the register and saw his name, and Paul’s and Sam’s.
Norah is here, too, at the villa; came on the same train,
but could not have known Carl was in it, as she said nothing
of having seen him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Norah! I am so glad,” Miss Errington said, while I
exclaimed, “Carl and Paul! Then, they must be in the
salon. Look, Jack, and find them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He did look, and saying “<em>Nix</em>,” sat down again, and
continued: “Carl is undoubtedly in the Casino by this
time cheek-by-jowl with Madame. She passed the villa
with her maid while Norah and I were standing on the
piazza. I got one flash of her black eyes in the moonlight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>She looked rather haggard, I thought, in spite of
the color on her cheeks. I don’t believe she half likes
our proximity to her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he laughed and was about to say more when I
warned him to stop, as the orchestra had ceased playing
and the curtain was going up. Everything which could
be done to make the stage attractive and like a private
parlor had been done. The furniture was of the daintiest
kind and most artistically arranged; the lights were shaded
just right, and there were flowers and potted plants
everywhere, with a whole forest of palms, tall ferns and
azaleas at the rear, where the singers were to enter.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first on the programme was a quartette sung in
Italian, and mildly cheered. Then a violin solo played
by the Earl,—also mildly cheered, with a faint attempt
at an encore. “Stupid,” I whispered to Jack, who did not
seem to be listening at all. Once, when there was a commotion
near the door he turned his head and then said to
me in a whisper, “That Yankee has just come in with
Paul. He’ll have a good time getting a seat.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I asked Jack to bring Paul to me, for I was longing
for a sight of his face, and wanted to see what effect the
sight of Katy would have upon him. But Jack said that
was impossible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you sure Carl is not with him?” I asked, and he
replied, “Yes, sure. He is probably at the Casino.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And he was! Since leaving Berlin he had traveled
slowly from place to place,—not quite certain whether he
was sufficiently scrubbed and boiled and ironed to join
the girl whom he felt a great desire to see. He had heard
of her triumphs in Berlin from some friends who were at
the concert, and for a moment had set his teeth together
hard that she should thus go against his known wishes.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>Then he thought, “Who or what am I that I should
raise so high a standard for her, and have so low a one
for myself? If she sings every day in the week I want
her, and mean to have her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Of Madame he frequently thought;—sometimes with
disgust, when he remembered Homburg, and again kindly
and charitably as one who was not to blame for being a
French woman, with all the instincts of her class. She
had amused and interested him, and shown that she cared
for him, and no young man is wholly insensible to the
preference of a handsome woman. Just where she was
he did not know, but fancied she was at Cannes. Of
Katy’s whereabouts he knew as little as of Madame’s,
but had an impression that she might be in Monte Carlo,
as in her last letter to Paul she had spoken of going there.
If so, he knew Jack and I must be with her, as we were
to join her in southern France, and with a hope to find
her and us he had come on the evening train.</p>

<p class='c014'>As our names were not on the hotel register he decided
to look for us in the Casino,—the resort of the most of
Monte Carlo’s visitors. Paul knew he could not enter
the play-rooms, but was anxious to see the place. Taking
him and Sam with him Carl left them to look about
in the vestibule, while he slowly made the circuit of the
rooms. Not finding us, or anyone he knew, he decided
to enquire at the different hotels and was about to leave
when he came upon Madame who was so heartily glad to
see him that for a time he was glad to see her. She was
thinner than when he left her in Homburg, with something
quiet and subdued in her manner, and a shade of
anxiety in her face which softened and toned down her
striking beauty.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is in straits again I dare say,” Carl thought, resolving
if she were he would not come to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>But Madame soon undeceived him. She had had splendid
luck as a rule at the tables, and, best of all, her brother-in-law
in Passy had been very generous and made over to
her more of the estate than she had hoped for.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I feel quite rich again,” she said, “and can pay you
what you have loaned me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this Carl laughed. She was welcome to all he had advanced
to her, he said, as he took a seat beside her at
one of the tables, more to see her play than to play himself.
After a little, however, the fever seized him, and he
was about to put down his first piece of gold when there
came an unexpected diversion in the shape of a young
boy, whose English voice rang out shrill and clear above
the hum of the room and startled every player there.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Carl, Carl, come quick! Katy is singing at the hotel,
and the people are yelling like mad. Come on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Paul, bareheaded and breathless, as he grasped
Carl’s hand before the gold was upon the table. In an
instant Carl was on his feet, electrified by the news Paul
brought and by the sight of him in those rooms so rigidly
forbidden to all under twenty-one. Close behind him
was an official, but before he could seize the child Carl interposed
and led him into the vestibule, where he met
Sam who had come in hot pursuit of the boy. Paul and
Sam had looked about the Casino until they were tired
and had then returned to the hotel, where they heard of
the concert in progress, but not who the singers were.
Paul, who was very fond of music, begged to go in, and
securing a ticket Sam managed to find standing-room for
himself at the rear of the salon, where, putting Paul upon
the window seat so that he could see over the heads of
the people, he stood, little dreaming of the surprise which
awaited him. The quartette was finished and the solo,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>and then there fell a great hush of expectancy as the people
studied their programs and waited during what seemed
to me an eternity, I was so nervous and excited.</p>

<p class='c014'>Would Katy fail? Would she mind that sea of heads,
or care for the eyes and glasses so soon to be leveled at
her? I didn’t know, and I felt as if I should scream if
the suspense were not soon ended. There was a stir among
the palms and azaleas, and something which sounded
like a long breath ran through the audience, as a tall
slim girl walked easily and gracefully to the front of the
stage, where she stood, acknowledging the cheers which
greeted her as composedly as if she had been at home
and about to sing a ballad to me. She was very lovely
in her simple white gown, with neither paint nor powder
on her face. Her fair hair was twisted into a loose coil
at the back of her head and kept in place by a long gold
pin, her only ornament, if I except the bunch of roses
fastened in her bosom. Nor did she need anything to set
off the matchless beauty of her face and the light which
shone in her eyes as they swept the house in one swift
glance until they fell upon Jack and me. Then she began
singing to <em>us</em>,—I was sure,—with a thought of home
in her heart,—singing in a language I could not understand,
but the music of which made me grow faint as a
great joy sometimes affects us. I could feel the stillness
of the people, which continued for a brief instant after
she finished; then, there was a perfect hail-storm of
cheers and flowers, which she received with the same
composure which had characterized her singing.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was at this point that Paul had started in quest of
Carl. He had been very quiet, Sam said, through the
quartette and solo, and was beginning to yawn when Katy
appeared.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>“Oh-h!” he began aloud, when Sam put his hand over
his mouth to stop him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then putting his arms around Sam’s neck and nearly
strangling him Paul whispered, “Is it she? Is it Katy?
It is! It is!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Shaking like a leaf he listened till the song was over
and then, before Sam knew what he was doing, he
sprang from the window stool and started for the Casino
to find Carl. Fortunately for him a party was just entering
the rooms, and taking advantage of the open door he
shot through it under the nose of the astonished official,
who put out his arm to detain him. But Paul was off like
the wind, darting from point to point until he found Carl
and startled him with the news that Katy was singing at
the hotel and the people were yelling like mad.</p>

<p class='c014'>Madame was white to her lips as she watched Carl going
from the room and knew that he was going from her
forever,—the only man she had ever really cared for.
Then she turned to her game with nerveless fingers
which could hardly hold the gold which she lost as fast
as she put it down.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meanwhile Carl was hurrying to the hotel, questioning
Paul as he went, but getting no very satisfactory replies.
Katy was singing and the house was full, was all Paul
could say. Carl had fancied it a little parlor entertainment,
but when he saw the crowd filling the salon and all
the scenic effect of stage accessories, he thought to
himself, “Katy has commenced her <em>Career</em>,” and a sting
like the cut of a knife ran through him for an instant,
with a feeling that he had lost her. With some difficulty
he made his way to a window, where, with Paul again on
the stool, he waited while an English girl wailed through
some sentimental trash about “Kissing me quick if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>love me.” Then there was another hush, reminding me
of the stillness said to brood in the air before the coming
of a cyclone. I believe I could have heard a pin drop,
and I did hear the beating of my heart and leaned over
on Jack just as the palms and azaleas stirred again, and
the tall slim girl in the white dress stood before us a second
time, her cheeks flushed with excitement and her
face beautiful as the faces of the angels whose pictures
we sometimes see. Two or three curls had escaped from
the coil at the back of her head and fallen down upon her
neck. These she tossed back with a graceful motion,
putting up her hands to fasten them in their place as
readily and naturally as if she had been in her dressing-room
at home. She was wholly unconventional, and this
was one of her great charms as she stood there, her eyes
again sweeping the house, but failing to take in the group
by the window watching her so eagerly, Paul only restrained
from calling out to her by Carl’s warning
“sh-sh,” spoken very low. If she had seen them and
known Carl was there she might not have sung as she did,—clearer,
sweeter than before,—going up and up without
a break until she reached a point from which it seemed
as if her voice could go no farther, and there it staid and
warbled and trilled with perfect ease like the robins she
used to imitate. And I was sure she saw and heard them,
and that The Elms and evergreens and woods were full of
them singing to her of Virginia and home, and she hated
to leave them. But with an easy movement she slid down
at last from the dizzy heights to which she had carried
us, and with a bow her song was ended.</p>

<p class='c014'>If the applause was great before it was thunderous now,
and she stood as if wondering what it all was for. Then
suddenly it subsided,—stopped by the same shrill, penetrating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>voice which had so startled the players in the
Casino. Paul had nearly tumbled off the window stool
with his stamping, and as soon as there was a lull he
called out “Hurrah, Katy! That was splendid, and we
are all here, Carl and Sam and <em>me</em>. Look!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Three-fourths of the audience were English and Americans,
who understood him, and all turned towards the
window where the little fellow’s hands were still in the
air clapping his approval. Then the cheers broke forth
again, louder than before, and this time almost as much
for Paul as for Katy. She was as white as her dress, and
it seemed to me had scarcely strength to leave the stage.
In response to the protracted calls for her reappearance
she only came in front of the palms and bowed. She
was not down to sing again, but when the program was
finished some of the English, who knew she was a southern
girl, sent up a request for a negro song, such as was
sung before the war. This everyone seconded and Katy
came again, looking now like a water-lily she was so pale,
as she stood for a moment wondering what to sing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope it will be Old Kentucky Home,” I whispered
to Jack, and as if my wish had been communicated to her
she began it at once, without any accompaniment, filling
the room with the old-time melody I had so often heard
as a child in the hemp fields and cabins at home, but
which had never sounded as it did now when Katy sang it
with so much feeling and pathos.</p>

<p class='c014'>This time I feared the people would break through the
floor, and was told that the proprietor did look in alarmed
at the noise. One more song was asked for and this time
it was Swannee River which she chose, changing the
words of the last two lines of each verse into</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, how my heart is growing weary,</div>
      <div class='line'>Far from my old Virginia home!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>There was now a difference in her singing which I was
quick to detect. It was just as sweet and full, but she
was tired and her voice showed it, and was like the homesick
cry of a child longing to lie down and rest in the
sunshine and beside the running brooks of its distant
home. And the people who knew she was from Virginia
understood it, and there was scarcely a dry eye in the
house when she finished. I was crying outright, while
Paul by the window was sobbing on Carl’s neck,—“Less
go home; it’s a heap nicer than here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was over at last. The people were hurrying out,—some
to try their luck at the Casino before the doors
closed, and all talking of the girl who had so delighted
them. As soon as he could Jack brought Carl and Paul
to me, and we made our way across the stage in quest of
Katy. She had already gone to the villa, where we found
her, limp and exhausted, lying upon a couch with Norah
ministering to her and piles of flowers around her, tributes
to her genius,—bouquets, baskets, horse-shoes, harps,—everything,
except pillows and crosses, which would
have made the room look more like a funeral than it did.
With a shout Paul threw himself upon Katy, nearly strangling
her with hugs, and saying, “Oh, Katy, how you <em>did</em>
sing! It made me think of the angels first, and then I
got sick at my stomach, didn’t I Carl?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Errington, Jack and I had all congratulated Katy
and kissed her, when Carl came up. At sight of him she
started to rise, but he put her gently back, saying, “Stay
where you are and rest. You sang splendidly, Katy. I
was proud of you,” and then he, too, kissed her on her
forehead. A wonderful light shone in Katy’s eyes as she
looked up at him; the tire all left her face, which was
bright with smiles and blushes as she declared she was
not fatigued at all.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>“Just for a moment when Paul hurrahed and I knew
he was there I did feel as if I should drop, it was so sudden,”
she said, “but after that I was all right, and when
I sang the Swannee River I was at home with the negroes,
and a part of the time falling into the duck pond with
Carl fishing me out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You were!” Carl exclaimed, bending over her until
his face almost touched hers; “that’s exactly where I
was,—there and in the woods after you were ill.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He had somehow gotten possession of her hand and
kept it until it was wanted to repress Paul, who, on the
other side of the couch, was hugging and kissing her at
intervals as the fancy took him. We were a very happy
family, and sat talking together until Norah, the only
sensible one among us, insisted that Katy must go to
bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s another day comin’, and it’s to-morrow now,”
she said, pointing to the clock which was striking one.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sam had been in to see us, and in his characteristic
way had expressed his approval of Katy’s singing. The
foreign lingo he didn’t understand, he said, but the tune
was tip-top, while Kentucky Home and Swanny River
took the cake, and made him think of Mirandy and the
little baby who died, and he snummed if he could keep
from crying.</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl, Paul and Sam went back to their hotel and the
lights were soon out in the little villa. In the Grand
Villa, however, there was one shining in Madame’s room,
and I could see her in full undress, moving rapidly about
as if packing her trunks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe she is going away,” I said to Jack, who gave
his little tantalizing whistle, and replied, “Shouldn’t
wonder!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>
  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>JULINA.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Immediately after breakfast the next morning Carl and
Paul joined us, and as the day was unusually warm for the
season we all sat in the verandah looking towards the
Casino in one direction and the Grand Villa to the left.
At this end of the piazza a large screen was standing, put
there to shut us from the eyes of our neighbors, when
they were sitting out as they often did. They were late
this morning like ourselves, and if Madame were leaving
it could not be until afternoon as the express train both
ways had passed. Norah was everywhere present, and
her shoes, which were new, creaked frightfully, showing
an excited state of mind, although she was in high spirits
and talked continually when near us. She had tried her
luck at the roulette table the previous night, she said, and
lost more than she won, but she didn’t care. She saw
the people and they saw her, and she guessed some of
them were not greatly pleased to renew her acquaintance.
We were wondering what she meant, when we saw Madame
come out and sit down with her back to us at the farthest
end of the long piazza. Before seating herself, however,
she glanced furtively around as if to assure herself that
she was not observed. Our position was such that
through a space between the screen and the side of the
villa we could see her without ourselves being seen. I
was the nearest to the screen and was looking at her when
I heard a very decided “Ah-hem!” twice repeated as if
to attract attention, and leaning forward I saw that Norah
had crossed our part of the grounds and was standing on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>those of the Grand Villa, evidently <em>Ah-hem-ming</em> to the
woman in the distance, who sat as immovable as a stone.
When the coughs did not prevail, Norah called out,
“Halloo!—halloo! How are you this morning?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Jack whistled, while Katy and I looked aghast at each
other. “Say, why don’t you speak to an old friend?”
came next from Norah, and then Madame partly turned
and said, “If you are talking to me, it’s no use. I understand
little English.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Jack whistled again, and Carl, who was sitting close to
Katy, rose to his feet and took a step forward as if to
stop Norah’s impertinence, but her next remark kept him
motionless as it did the rest of us. Norah had picked up
enough French to understand Madame, and straightening
herself back she answered: “The Lord save us! Born
in <em>Vermont</em>, and can’t speak English! That’s too much,
but you don’t cheat me. We worked together in Miss
Haverleigh’s kitchen too long for me not to know <em>Julina
Smith</em>, in spite of your painted hair. I heard of you from
your Cousin Jane, who is in a hotel in Dresden, where my
sister is cook. She told me you’re a great lady and all that,
but I didn’t spose you’d refuse to speak to me and say you
didn’t know English. That’s nonsense. Come and see
the folks from Virginny. They’re all here but Miss
Fanny.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We were all outside the screen now, and standing upon
the grass—except Miss Errington, who had no special interest
in the matter, and Carl, who, at the mention of
Julina Smith, had dropped into his chair, where he
sat while we went out to meet our former maid. She
was very pale as she rose up and faced us, with the look
of a hunted animal, which has been run down and sees no
way of escape. She had played her game and lost, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>now she made the best of it and came towards us at once,
moving slowly as if in pain. Paul had always been fond
of her, and when he saw who she was he ran forward with
a shout.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Madame, Madame, I’m so glad,” he said, and
threw himself into her arms.</p>

<p class='c014'>This seemed to reassure her. Kissing the little boy
she held him by the hand and came up to us, as far from
the Grand Villa as possible. She was very pale and the
dark rings under her eyes were not works of art, but the
result of anxiety and loss of sleep. She spoke very low,
but every word was distinct and in perfect English.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I am, or was, Julina Smith,” she began, “and
I have worked in Mrs. Haverleigh’s kitchen with Norah,
but society would recognize me as your equal now, and it
is your boast in America that one can rise if he has the
will to do it. I had the will, and I have risen. When I
came to France my aunt had sold what I called her chateau
near Fontainebleau and was keeping a Pension in Paris.
She gave me advantages and I profited by them. We had
the best of people, mostly French, and among them Monsieur
Felix. He was much older than I and very rich, or
I thought him so. He was a good man,—not very deep,—but
good. He loved me and married me, thinking me
wholly French and that my name was Julie Du Bois. He
never knew I was born in America, or could speak English.
If he had he wouldn’t have cared, he was so fond and
proud of me, but he might have told of it and that I wished
to prevent. My aunt died. I had no relations left in
Paris to betray me,—no relatives this side of the water,
except Jane, who is only a second cousin, and I went to
work to lose all traces of my former self. Partly as a disguise,
and partly because I thought it would give me a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>more striking appearance, I bleached my hair. You remember
my teeth. No one could forget them. I had
them extracted and went for a new set to a famous American
dentist. He did his best for me, and when I gained
in flesh, as I soon did, the metamorphose was complete,
and deceived even those who had been at my aunt’s Pension
and knew me as the young girl who sometimes played
for them to dance. These I did not often meet. I avoided
everyone I had ever known, in my morbid fear of being
recognized. My husband’s family is a good one, and as
his wife I was somebody and I enjoyed it and passed for
a lady,—as I think I am.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She smiled bitterly here, and then went on: “When I
first saw this dear little boy,” and she passed her hand
caressingly over Paul’s head, “I was drawn to him at
once, and my affection for him was not feigned. I was
glad to see Carl again and afraid he would know me, but
he didn’t. I sometimes thought his man Sam suspected
me and knew he did not like me. He lived in the same
town with my father when I was a girl.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jerusalem! I told you so,” came energetically from
Sam, who had come from the hotel and seeing us standing
together had joined us in time to hear a part of what Madame
was saying.</p>

<p class='c014'>To him she gave a look of scorn, as one quite beneath
her, and then went on, a little stammeringly now, for she
had reached the hardest part of her story, and her eyes
went over and beyond us to the piazza where Carl’s boots
were visible as he sat motionless, but listening to every
word.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was glad to see Carl,” she said again, speaking
as if something were choking her. “I always liked him
as a boy, although he was very proud,—so proud that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>had he known I was Julina, my changed position as Madame
Felix would hardly have atoned for the fact that I
once served his mother. I am a woman and human, and
it was a gratification to know that I could interest and
attract him and I tried my best to do it, with what success
he can tell you. But,” and here she fixed her eyes on
Katy, “I never found him anything but a true, honorable
man, whom any good girl might trust. I think I amused
him, but he was not of my kind. His New England training
unfitted him for my set and he broke away from us.
Better for him that he did, although we lead a very happy
life as a rule. I am half French by birth and all French
by nature and habit. Bohemian French, too, and like it.
The life suits me. It couldn’t suit Carl. There is too
much Puritan there. He is happier with you, and there
is no reason why you should not take him as readily as if
he had never known me. I saw your sister in London
two years ago and avoided her. I did not know you were
my neighbor here until I learned your name. I had no
fear you would recognize me. You were too young when
I knew you, but you troubled me greatly in the Casino,
though not as much as you did”; and now she addressed
me: “I did not know you were in Europe, and when I
saw you and Mr. Fullerton I felt that my time had come.
I was sure of it when I heard Norah’s voice last night as
I passed on my way to the Casino and saw her later in
the rooms. I might deceive everyone else, but Norah
never.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s as sure as you’re born,” came from Norah,
and Madame went on: “I meant to leave this morning,
but the rest of my party go to-morrow and I waited. I
am glad I did. Glad I have told you all, and you may
not believe me, but I am so glad to see you again, and I
wish we were friends, but that we can never be.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>“Why not?” Katy said, going over to the woman and
offering her hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>Madame’s confession and what she said of Carl had
wiped out all her animosity, and she felt only pity for the
woman who had been so humiliated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Katy, Katy!” Madame exclaimed, bursting into
tears and throwing her arms around Katy’s neck. “I do
not deserve this from you. God bless you, and make you
happy. Carl is worthy of you, even if he has been soiled
a little by contact with me. It is only a speck which your
love will wipe out. I tried to make him care for me but
could not. He was never more to me than a friend.”</p>

<p class='c014'>All this she said very low, as she continued to cry.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a stir at the end of the long piazza of the
Grand Villa. The Count had come out and was looking
curiously in our direction. In a moment Madame was
herself,—erect and dignified and speaking in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We leave to-morrow. It is not necessary that my
party should know everything or anything. They despise
the <i><span lang="fr">bourgeois</span></i>; they would despise Julina Smith. They
think I come from a good old Norman family, now extinct.
Let them continue to think so. I shall tell them I had
met some of you before. I know what to say;—trust me,
and—good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She wrung Katy’s hand, kissed Paul and went across the
lawn and piazza to where the Count stood waiting for her.
What she told him we never knew,—something satisfactory,
no doubt, as he was driving with her that afternoon,
and in the evening we saw him by her side at the gaming
table in the Casino. But we didn’t disturb or go near her.
Early the next morning piles of baggage left the Grand
Villa, and we were up in time to see Madame’s black bonnet
disappearing through the shrubbery as she went down
to the station.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>“Good riddance to her. I don’t believe in her, for all
of her tears and fine words. Not speak English indeed!”
came from Norah as she watched her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Norah had stopped for awhile in Dresden where she
had some relatives, and among them a cousin employed in
a hotel where Jane Du Bois was also an employee. This
girl, who could speak English, was very friendly with
Norah, and when she heard she was from America made
many inquiries about the country to which she had some
thought of emigrating, and where, she said, she once had
some relatives,—Smiths,—who lived in —— Vermont.
Did Norah know them?</p>

<p class='c014'>“I knew a Julina Smith from that place years ago,”
Norah replied, whereupon it came out that Julina and
Jane were second cousins, but had never met.</p>

<p class='c014'>Jane had heard, though, of Julina’s fine marriage with
Monsieur Felix of Passy, and that she was now a grand
lady, ignoring the few relatives she had left and living in
great splendor until her husband died. Where she was
now, Jane neither knew nor cared. Norah, too, was quite
indifferent to the whereabouts of her former associate and
never dreamed of finding her at Monte Carlo. She had
met Jack on the piazza as he was returning for my fan,
and the two were talking together when Madame passed
on her way to the Casino. She was a woman to be noticed
anywhere and Norah looked curiously and rather admiringly
at her as she drew near. In Jack’s mind there had
always been a strong suspicion as to Madame’s identity.
Surely he had seen her before, and if so Norah might help
him to solve the mystery. He was not, however, prepared
for what followed when to her question “Who is that
lady coming?” he replied “Madame Julie Felix. Do
you know her?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>Madame was close to them and the moonlight shone full
on her face and eyes, which flashed for a moment on Norah
and were quickly withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’d smile if I didn’t know Julina Smith!” Norah exclaimed.
“I heard she was Madame Felix and a great
lady. Well, I’d of known them eyes in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>Eureka!</em> I thought so,” Jack said, hurrying in for the
fan and making no further conversation with Norah with
regard to Madame.</p>

<p class='c014'>When left alone Norah was not quite so sure as she had
been. “But I’ll satisfy myself,” she thought. “It
would be like Julina to masquerade this way and not let
them know who she was.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She accordingly went to the Casino and satisfied herself
that Madame was Julina. Of her intimacy with Carl she
knew nothing, or in her wrath she might have exposed
her at the table. In her mind Julina was only passing as
a great lady whom it would be her pleasure to unmask,
which she did effectually.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madame Felix!” she repeated at intervals through
the day. “To think it should come true what she said
about being rich, with diamonds, and a tail to her gown a
yard long, and she not lettin’ on who she was. We are
well to be rid of her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We all thought so, too, and breathed freer with the
doors and windows of the Grand Villa closed, although I
missed the excitement of watching its inmates and half
wished we might have seen more of Julina.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>CARL AND KATY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Carl had been indignant at Norah when she first called
out to Madame, but the moment he heard the name Julina
Smith he felt, as he afterwards told Katy, as if a feather
could have knocked him down. Everything connected
with her, recurred to him and he knew it was Julina before
she acknowledged it and came forward to meet us. I think
she wanted to see him; but he did not join us, and he
spent most of the day at the hotel in his room, seeing no
one except Sam, who felicitated himself upon the fact that
he had always mistrusted Madame.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I never thought of Julina,—the lyenist girl there
was in town,” he said;—“with airs enough to sink a ship.
Why, she’d deceive the very elect.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was to Carl, who made no reply. He was very
sore on the subject of Madame, who had duped him so
completely, and did not care to discuss her. That evening
he dined with us, and was very quiet all through the
dinner, during which no allusion was made to Madame.
Katy and I had already talked her over by ourselves.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hated her at first,” Katy said, “but when I saw her
standing there so brave under the lash of Norah’s tongue,
telling us all about it, and knew how hard it must
be for her to do it, I was sorry for her, and I forgave
her everything, even to Carl. It was splendid in her to
exonerate him as she did. Of course he was only her
friend.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was glad Katy took this view of it and watched eagerly
for the denouement of the drama I felt sure was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>come. The day Madame left, Carl and Jack and Paul and
Sam went on an excursion to the country and did not return
until time for dinner. The night was cool for Monte
Carlo, and after dinner we all gathered around the fire
which had been kindled in the salon, except Katy, who
was on the piazza with Carl. He had come from the hotel
and was walking up and down with her in the moonlight,
which was at its full that night, making the town almost
as light as day. At last he came in for a warm cloak
which he put around her and then made her sit down in a
reclining chair adjusted to such an angle that when she
leaned back in it, as she soon did, the moonlight fell
upon her face, showing plainly every change in its expression
as he talked to her. He had drawn another and
lower chair to her side, and sitting down by her took one
of her hands in his and held it while he went over every
incident of his life which he thought at all crooked, and
dwelling longest on his intimacy with Madame Felix, as
that was the episode he most deplored and of which he
was most ashamed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot account for the influence she had over me,”
he said. “If I believed in mesmerism I should say it was
that, but I don’t. Consequently it must have been my
own weakness and love of flattery, for she did flatter me
and amuse me, and, fool that I was, I was really proud of
her notice, believing in her blue blood and connection
with the old aristocracy of which she so modestly hinted,
and all the time she was Julina Smith and I didn’t guess
it. You don’t know how I hate myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With her head thrown back on the chair rest,—and her
eyes closed, Katy listened with the moonlight falling on
her face, from whose expression Carl could form no conclusion
as to her thoughts until, as he grew more and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>more condemnatory of himself, she started up and with a
girl’s perversity began to defend Madame.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t think her so bad,” she said. “She liked you
when you were a boy and wrote you a love letter,—Annie
has told me about it,—and you snubbed her awfully. Afterwards
you met as equals and you were pleased with her,
as you are with every handsome woman, and she is handsome
if she does bleach her hair, and I am not certain but
it improves her. It is certainly striking. She was kind
to Paul and kind to you, and being French and full of intrigue
it is natural that she would want to see if she could
do with the man what she couldn’t with the boy,—attract
him. She succeeded because you thought her Madame
Felix, with blue blood in her veins. She is no worse now
that you know she is Julina Smith with Yankee blood instead
of blue, and I don’t think it a bit nice for you to
throw stones at her after she exonerated you from everything
as she did.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy had made her speech and lay back again in her
chair with her eyes on Carl who had listened to her amazed.
If she could thus excuse and defend Madame, would
she not also overlook his own shortcomings. She had
been very gracious to him since he came to Monte Carlo,
and especially since Madame declared herself as Julina,
and something in her eyes emboldened him to put his
face down close to hers, while he poured out words of
love which must be answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why don’t you speak to me?” he said at last, and
Katy replied, “How can I when you are stopping my
mouth with kisses. Let me sit up, please.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Raising herself in her chair, and smoothing her hair
which was a good deal tumbled, she said, “What about
<em>my Career</em>? You saw me on the stage the other night.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>Would you rather have seen me dead than there? Would
you be willing to see me in more public places,—real opera
houses,—if I were your wife? Wouldn’t you mind being
known only as my husband, waiting for me at home, or,
worse yet, waiting for me behind the scenes, where pandemonium
reigns and if there is anything bad in the actors
it comes out? Would you like to read how divinely I sang
or danced,—it might come to that, you know? And my
picture would be in the shop windows and in the papers
with the horrid cuts we sometimes see there. Do you
love me well enough to stand all this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was looking intently at him as she talked, and Carl
writhed at the picture she drew of him as the husband of
a prima donna. Was that frail young girl worth the humiliation
he should be called upon to endure at times, if
she persisted in her Career? Was his love for her strong
enough to overbalance every thing? As Fanny once had
weighed her love for Jack against money and position, so
he now weighed his love for Katy against her Career, and
Katy conquered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, my darling,” he said, drawing her face to him
until it was hidden from the moonlight and nearly smothered
on his bosom, “I love you so much that forty Careers
shall not stand in my way, if you will take me. Sing
in public if you want to, and I will wait at home, or in
the green-room, or out doors, or anywhere, and when I
hear the shouts of applause I shall comfort myself with
thinking, ‘Applaud her all you like, the more the better.
You can’t spoil her. To you she is the great singer, but
she is <em>my wife</em>!’”</p>

<p class='c014'>I wonder if Carl thought himself a hero when he said
that. Katy did. Disengaging herself from him she lifted
up her face which, either from the moonlight or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>pallor which had settled upon it, made Carl think that
just so the faces of the glorified dead must look when entering
Paradise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Carl,” she said, and her lips quivered and the tears
stood in her eyes, “I have heard you. Now, listen to
me. I have dreamed so much of a Career, in which I
know I should succeed and in which I should be comparatively
happy. I like the excitement,—the sight of the
people,—the applause,—the flowers,—and most of all I
like to sing; but, Carl, I have learned that there is something
better than all this, and that is love such as you
offer me. Wait a minute,”—and she drew back as he
was about to take her in his arms. “Hear me through
before you squeeze my breath out of me again. You have
conceded everything. Do you think I will accept the
sacrifice and make no return? No, Carl. I am not
ashamed to say that I love you so much that I am willing
to give up my Career for you. If I didn’t love you and
should never marry it would be different; a married woman
has no business on the stage unless her husband is there,
too,—and I don’t think you have the slightest aptitude for
it. You could only sit in the audience or wait in the
green-room, or if we traveled on our own hook, as the
Hathern-Haverleigh troupe, you might take the money
and tickets at the door. How would you like that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl did not reply, and she went on: “I don’t want
you at the door selling tickets, or in the green-room, or
with the audience, or anywhere except with me, and I
with you. Are you satisfied?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Each had offered a great sacrifice to the other and there
was perfect trust and love between them, and when the
moon, which for a moment had been hidden by a cloud,
came out again it shone on two faces so close to each
other that they almost seemed but one.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>“My darling, my darling!” was all Carl said, or had
time to say, for the clock was striking twelve, and the
people were swarming out of the Casino and coming, some
of them, past our villa on their way home.</p>

<p class='c014'>Jack had been asleep a long time, but I was awake and
waiting for Katy, who, I feared, might take cold, sitting
so long in the night air. Was there ever a girl cold, I
wonder, from sitting with her lover? Katy surely was
not, judging from her crimson cheeks and hot hands when
I joined her in the hall. I heard her as she came up the
stairs and stopped at my door, whispering very low,
“Annie, Annie, are you awake?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I knew what she wanted, and remembering how I had
longed for some sympathetic ear to listen to my happiness
when Jack proposed to me, I slipped on my dressing-gown
and bed-shoes and went out to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Annie,” she began, as we sat down together.
“I am so glad that I could not sleep till I had told some
one. I am to give up all thought of the stage and marry
Carl. I don’t see why I have kept him off so long when
I have always loved him since I fell into the duck pond,
and he has loved me,—I am sure of it now,—no matter
where he was, or with whom; there was never a moment
that his heart was not ready to open for me if I would
come into it. He said so, and I believe it. I know the
worst there is to know, and it is not bad for a young man
like him. A little fickle, with escapades and flirtations
which meant nothing, because he always saw my face
everywhere and it kept him from falling. He said so.
And then,—Julina! He takes that most to heart because
he was so deceived, and he really was pleased with her.
He said so. And I don’t care. She’s a handsome woman,
who knows just how to make a young man like her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>And I don’t blame her much either. He snubbed her
awfully when he was a boy, and when she met him on
equal terms it was natural that she, being French and
steeped in art, should try to be even with him. I hated
her at first, but when she stood up before us and confessed
I forgave her everything. Paul likes her and she
likes him. There must be something good about her,
but she can never move Carl again. He said so.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Katy’s “He said so” was very frequent, showing how
implicit was her faith in Carl, and because <em>he said so</em> there
could be no appeal. For an hour we talked, or rather
Katy did, while I sat in a huddle trying to follow her and
keep warm. Then as the clock struck one there came
two peremptory calls from either end of the hall,—one
from Miss Errington for Katy, and one from Jack for me.
I think Katy would willingly have sat up all night telling
what <em>he said</em>, but Jack’s assertion that unless I came at
once he was coming for me, broke up the conference,
until after breakfast, when Carl came to be congratulated
and accepted as Katy’s promised husband.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.—Annie’s Story Continued.</span><br> <span class='c013'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>It was a happy winter we spent in Florence and Rome
and Sorrento, going in the early spring to Venice and the
Lakes, and later on to Paris. Here there were four delightful
weeks, and I wanted to stay longer, but Carl hurried
us on to London, where he was to be married. We
all urged him to wait until we were home at The Elms, but
he said No,—he had waited long enough; and so one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>morning in early June there was a very quiet wedding in
—— church, with only a few personal friends present,
and Katy was Mrs. Carl Haverleigh. There was a wedding
breakfast at the Grand, where we were stopping, and
where on our return from church we found a letter and
package from Julina,—now the Countess de Varré! Fortune
had favored her again. The brother-in-law had died
and left her a good share of the money he had taken from
her. The chateau at Passy was hers once more, where
she was living with the Count and very happy, as a titled
lady. Accompanying her letter was an individual tea set
of exquisite china, with gold lined spoons and sugar tongs
and silver tray,—her wedding gift to Katy and Carl conjointly,
with a hope that sometimes when they were using
it they would think of one who was not so bad as to
American eyes she might seem to be. Katy was pleased,
but Carl did not express himself, and I do not think he
has ever yet taken a cup of tea from the pretty set which
stands on Katy’s little tea-table in Boston and is greatly
admired.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was the middle of July when we reached New York
and found Fanny waiting for us on the dock, and insisting
upon our going with her to the cottage she had rented at
Newport. It was too hot for either Virginia or Washington,
she said, and she carried her point so far as Carl and
Katy and Miss Errington were concerned. Jack said he
must go home to his business, and I, of course, went with
him, taking Paul, who was beginning to droop with travel
and excitement. It was a lovely summer day when we
drove up the avenue to our home, where Phyllis and many
of our neighbors greeted us with a warmth which told us
that nowhere in the world were there truer friends than
in Lovering.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>“And nowhere so pleasant a home,” I said, as I went
all over the house, happy as a child to be back again
among the Virginia hills with her blue sky over my head
and the breath of the woods and pines upon my cheek.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was better than Newport, where Katy was a great
belle and where Fan had more than one offer of marriage,
which she promptly declined. She was on the best of
terms with her sister-in-law, and when the season was
over the two went together to the house in Washington.
Carl and Katy came to us and staid all through the autumn
and were joined at Thanksgiving by Fan and Miss
Errington. What a day that was,—and dinner, too, which
Phyllis thought she superintended, although the real head
was Norah, who had come with Katy, but who for once
was careful of the old negress’ feelings and humored her
fancies.</p>

<p class='c014'>Towards the close of dinner Katy said, “We have no
wine, but water will do as well. Let us drink to the
health of the Countess de Varré.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good,” Carl said, and we drank to her health and
amused ourselves with reminiscences of her when she was
Julina Smith and served us as our maid.</p>

<p class='c014'>Phyllis had received the news of her advancement with
a snort and a dangerous topple of her turban. She had
never liked the girl, and when, as she chanced to be in the
room, we drank her health, she exclaimed, “Oh, my
Lord, my Lord! Ef I couldn’t drink suffin better’n July,
I’d go dry a spell.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is many years since that day and many more since
most of the incidents of this story took place. Jack and
I are quite old people now, or the younger generation
think us so. I am forty-seven, and have a double chin.
Jack calls me a roly-poly, while a boy, who stands six feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>and has eyes like Jack, says I waddle like a duck when I
walk, but am the sweetest and jolliest little mother in the
world. Jack is fifty-three and getting grey and stout, and
is a fine type of the well-conditioned southern gentleman,—not
too much pressed with business, but still with
enough to do. He has been to Congress twice and there
is talk of sending him as a State Senator next year. One
winter we took a house in Washington, and I staid there
with Jack and saw all I ever care to see of fashionable society.
Fanny was on the top wave, and as Katy was with
us a part of the time we were made much of and went
everywhere,—sometimes to three different places in one
night, and by the close of the long term I was quite worn
out and glad to get back to the old home under The Elms,
with only Phyllis and a bright mulatto girl to look after
instead of the crew I had in Washington, who stole my
handkerchiefs and collars and Jack’s socks and wore my
black silk dress to one of their carousals, and who always
hoped to die if they had done anything of the sort when
charged with the offense.</p>

<p class='c014'>The tall boy, with eyes like Jack, is our first-born,—our
son Hathern, who is nearly seventeen, and preparing
for Yale. My choice is for some other college, but only
Yale will suit him and we have yielded, his father telling
him, however, that if he thought to join in all the sports
which have sometimes made the students of Yale a by-word
as well as a terror to the towns they visited, he
would be mistaken, as he had no money to spend that
way,—“and without money,” he added, “you can’t be
<em>in it</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hathern, who is a splendid specimen of young manhood
and fond of athletic sports of all kinds, looked rather blue
until Fan came from Washington and he took her for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>drive. That night he confided to his sisters that aunt
Fan was a brick! That he intended to stand well in all
his classes and with his teachers and to be graduated with
honor, and never drink a drop of anything stronger than
water, <em>but</em>—he was also going to be <em>in it</em>; and with the
enthusiasm of a girlhood which sees more to admire in
an athlete than in a student, the sisters agreed that Aunt
Fan <em>was</em> a brick,—that the cold water and standing well
in classes and graduating with honor was all right, but
the athletics were more fun, and it was worth some
knocks and scratches and bruises, and even a broken
bone now and then, to be <em>in it</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>These girls, who are fourteen, are twins, named Fan and
Ann, and very much like the originals, except that Fan
is not quite as handsome or as tall as her aunt, and Ann
is taller and handsomer than her mother. Otherwise,
they are much like the girls introduced in the first chapter
of this story, and often, when I see them flitting through
the house and grounds, doing the things Fan and I used
to do,—saying the things we used to say, in voices much
like ours,—the years of my life roll back and I am young
as they are, with as little care or thought for the
future. Then Jack comes in and calls me Annie-mother,
a name he resumed the day he brought Hathern to me
and said, “Would you like to see our boy?” and I am
myself again,—a matron-mother of forty-seven, but feeling
scarcely older than when I was a girl like my Fan and
Ann.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fanny, as I call her now, to distinguish her from my
daughter, is a beautiful woman still, and she knows it and
the world knows it, and had she chosen she might have
married a General or a Judge or an ex-Governor, or have
used her large fortune to build up the impoverished estate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>of an Englishman with a title. But she would have none
of them. “I am very happy as I am,” she says, and I
think she is. She is more quiet and dignified than she
used to be and strangers call her proud. But to me she
is the same Fan as ever,—a part of myself,—while to Jack
I think she is really a sister whom he honors and consults
in some matters more than he does me. She comes and
goes as she pleases. Is sometimes in Washington,—sometimes
in Newport, sometimes in Florida, where the
Hathern villa is a reality, sometimes at The Plateau,—and
once she spent eighteen months in Europe with
Paul, whom, in a way, she has adopted. He is now
twenty-seven, with a refined, delicate face and an air of
languor about him caused by his weak back, which has
always troubled him more or less. He is a graduate of
Yale, and when Hathern decided to go there he began to
question him as to what he did, but soon gave it up, saying
Paul was no good. He didn’t know about anything
but rules and books and professors and wasn’t <em>in it</em> at all!
When he chooses he stops with us, or with Katy, but is
most with Fanny, who needs him more than we do.
“Our room” at The Plateau has been given to him and
fitted up as a kind of study, or den, where he spends a
great deal of his time with his books. He is something
of a scientist and goes into every <em>ism</em> and <em>ology</em> and <em>osophy</em> of
the day. Just now he has taken up microbes and is studying
their habits, if they have any, and he writes long articles
for Reviews, in which he tries to interest Fan and
Hathern and the twins, and sometimes myself, but generally
fails, as they are too deep for us.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is one, however, who always listens and applauds,
although it is doubtful whether he understands a word,
and that is Sam Slayton, Fan’s factotum, who takes care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>of The Plateau when she is there and takes care of it
when she is not, and makes more at it than he did in his
grocery. He has never married again, but every year he
goes to Vermont to visit Mirandy’s grave and mourn.
During the mourning he wears a tall hat with a band of
crape around it, and on his return to The Plateau puts it
away carefully until the period comes again. As it is the
hat he wore on his wedding trip it is somewhat out of
date, but he does not mind it and felt greatly insulted
when last winter some one wanted to borrow it for Uriah
Heep to wear at a Dickens Carnival given for the Y. M.
C. A.’s in Lovering.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Errington is often with us. The twins call her
Aunt Cornie, and think almost as much of her as of their
stately Aunt Fanny. Some meddling person has told
them of that chapter in Fan’s life and their father’s which
was almost a tragedy and I do not think they have quite
forgiven her for her part in it, although each has said to
me that she would rather have me for her mother than
Auntie Fan, who is so grand and cold. Fan has made
her will and left her money to Paul and my children, with
a proviso for Katy’s should any be born to her. As yet
Carl and Katy are childless, but very, very happy with
each other. They travel a great deal and when at home
their handsome new house on Commonwealth Avenue in
Boston is usually filled with guests and Katy makes a
charming hostess and Carl a delightful host. In most respects
he is the same genial, handsome Carl we knew as
a boy, with something about him which makes everyone
his friend. He still admires a pretty face when he sees
it, and discusses its points with Katy, but always winds
up by saying, “But by Jove, she can’t hold a candle to
you, the most beautiful woman I ever saw, and the older
you grow the handsomer you are.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>I think Carl is right, and that, if possible, Katy is lovelier
in her maturity than when she was a girl. Paul worships
her; Hathern worships her; the twins worship her;
we all worship her, and yet she is not spoiled. She was
a sweet, unselfish, loving child, and is a loving, unselfish
woman. If she has ever regretted the Career she gave
up for Carl, she has made no sign, and seems to find her
greatest happiness with him. Occasionally, when she is in
Lovering she sings in our pretty Concert Hall and everybody
comes to hear her, but never have I heard her sing
as she sang at Monte Carlo, or seen upon her face the expression
I saw there after she knew Carl was in the audience
listening to her. Now, when she sings in Lovering
he is to all intents and purposes stage manager, adjusting
the lights and the piano, and the curtain, and then sitting
behind the scenes and applauding her with the rest.
Once when she seemed to have excelled herself and the
hall rang like the salon in Monte Carlo, he said to her
after it was over, “Upon my soul, Katy, I believe
you’d have made your mark if you had gone on with your
Career. How would you like to begin it now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>For an instant there was a look on Katy’s face which
made me think of a war-horse scenting the battle. Then
it faded and she shook her head saying, “Too late, my
voice will crack pretty soon,—or <em>wobble</em> as Hathern says
old Mrs. Mosier’s does when she tries to sing high. I
am content as I am and perfectly happy with you.”
What answer Carl made I do not know, for I discreetly
left the room just as he took her in his arms. Carl is
rather demonstrative, and the twins say that if Katy could
have been squeezed and kissed to death she would have
died long ago. Norah runs the house in Commonwealth
Avenue and runs Carl and Katy, too; but as she allows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>them a good many privileges, and is wholly faithful to
their interests, they do not mind it, and in most matters
let her have her way.</p>

<p class='c014'>Phyllis is very old,—how old she does not know,—but
she is wholly disabled from taking charge of the kitchen,
where a younger woman is installed as cook, with Phyllis
as nominal superintendent. Only in this way can I hope
for peace. The instructions which Norah left so many
years ago have been found and tacked up over the sink,
and are held up as iron rules to the patient, much enduring
Sarah, who says, “I ’specs we mus’ let the ole woman
have her way, or think she has it; but, Lord bless
you, I has to cheat her. I can read writin’ an’ she can’t,
an’ I reads it wrong a heap o’times, an’ when she gits too
high I done tell her I’m follerin’ Norah O’Rock’s ’structions,
an’ she comes down like a lam’. I knows how to
manage her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The house under The Elms has been enlarged and improved
and is, I think, an ideal country home, although
Hathern and the twins would like a square hall and a
tower and many projections here and there, and porcelain
bath-tubs and electric lights,—and a big fortune to keep
it all up, their father says, his solid sense always coming
to the front when the young blood gets rampant. Hathern
has his horse and wheel, and the twins have each her
riding pony,—presents from Fan, who usually gives them
what they want, if it is feasible and proper. Black
Beauty died years ago and was buried in the woods behind
The Plateau, with Fan and Paul as mourners.</p>

<p class='c014'>And now the story winds to a close. It was commenced
in June, the month of roses, when the south wind
blew softly through the doors of the wide hall, and on the
lawn outside there was the sound of young voices in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>tennis court, where Paul and Hathern and the twins were
playing. Jack was away on business, and Phyllis was
sitting under the dogwood tree watching the play and
sympathizing equally with both sides. She is sitting
there now asleep in the sunshine, but the tennis court is
silent and the twins’ ponies and Hathern’s horse stand in
the lane with their noses on the gate looking towards the
house as if asking why they are not taking their usual canter
through the woods or over the smooth turnpike.
Jack is again away on business as he was a year ago, and
I am alone, for Fanny and Carl and Katy, who are here,
have gone with the young people to the town hall, which
is filled with flowers and ferns and evergreens. It is
Memorial Day, when, north and south, east and west, the
graves of our soldiers will be decorated by the loving
hands of many who were not born until after the war and
to whom that time is only a dark page of history nearly
blotted out.</p>

<p class='c014'>Others there are, however, whose hearts will ache with
the old pain as they think of the loved ones who, whether
their cause were right or wrong, gave their lives for it
and died on the battlefield. Boxes of rare flowers, ordered
by Fanny, have come from Washington, and few
graves will be more beautiful than the two where Charlie
and The Boy are lying. Hathern and the twins have
taken the Stars and Stripes and the Stars and Bars from
the faded uniforms of grey and blue, where they have
hung so long, and carried them to the little cemetery
across the field. From where I sit I can see them side by
side waving in the breeze and occasionally touching each
other as if in friendly greeting. Through the open doors
of the wide hall where I am writing the wind blows in and
the wind blows out as it did a year ago, breathing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>peace in the land. In the distance I hear the sound of
martial music, and know that the procession has formed
and will soon be marching down the street, and I wonder
if I shall have time to finish my story before it passes The
Elms. With the first beat of the drum Phyllis rouses
from her sleep under the dogwood tree, and coming to
me says, “It seems mighty like de wah, but thank God
dat is over and gone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The procession is in sight. Hathern is carrying the
tattered flag, and Paul is walking by his side, laden with
flowers. They have stopped opposite the hillside cemetery.
They are decorating the graves of Charlie and The Boy.
My eyes are full of tears, and I cannot write any more.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. Holmes’ stories are universally read. Her admirers are numberless.
She is in many respects without a rival in the world of fiction. Her characters
are always life-like, and she makes them talk and act like human beings, subject
to the same emotions, swayed by the same passions, and actuated by the same
motives which are common among men and women of every-day existence. Mrs.
Holmes is very happy in portraying domestic life. Old and young peruse her
stories with great delight, for she writes in a style that all can comprehend.”—<cite>New
York Weekly.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'><b>The North American Review</b>, vol. 81, page 557, says of Mrs. Mary
J. Holmes’ novel “English Orphans”:—“With this novel of Mrs. Holmes’ we
have been charmed, and so have a pretty numerous circle of discriminating readers
to whom we have lent it. The characterization is exquisite, especially so far as
concerns rural and village life, of which there are some pictures that deserve to
be hung up in perpetual memory of types of humanity fast becoming extinct.
The dialogues are generally brief, pointed, and appropriate. The plot seems
simple, so easily and naturally is it developed and consummated. Moreover, the
story thus gracefully constructed and written, inculcates without obtruding, not
only pure Christian morality in general, but, with especial point and power, the
dependence of true success on character, and of true respectability on merit.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. Holmes’ stories are all of a domestic character, and their interest,
therefore, is not so intense as if they were more highly seasoned with sensationalism,
but it is of a healthy and abiding character. The interest in her tales
begins at once, and is maintained to the close. Her sentiments are so sound, her
sympathies so warm and ready, and her knowledge of manners, character, and
the varied incidents of ordinary life is so thorough, that she would find it difficult
to write any other than an excellent tale if she were to try it.”—<cite>Boston
Banner.</cite></p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
